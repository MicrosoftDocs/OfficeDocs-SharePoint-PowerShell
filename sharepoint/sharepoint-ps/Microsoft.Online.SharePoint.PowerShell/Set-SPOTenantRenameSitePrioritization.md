# Set-SPOTenantRenameSitePrioritization

## SYNOPSIS

Allows prioritization of a site for early execution, as part of [Advanced Tenant Rename](/sharepoint/change-your-sharepoint-domain-name#advanced-tenant-rename-preview).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-SPOTenantRenameSitePrioritization -SiteUrl <String> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Allows for the specified site to be prioritized.

As part of
[Advanced Tenant Rename](/sharepoint/change-your-sharepoint-domain-name#advanced-tenant-rename-preview),
organizations can prioritize up to 4,000 sites for initial execution among all other sites in your
organization as part of the overall rename operation.

It is possible to start prioritizing sites only once the rename operation has been scheduled using
the [Start-SPOTenantRename](Start-SPOTenantRename.md) cmdlet.

Please note that prioritizing a site is not a guarantee that it will complete first. There are
several factors that can affect processing times, and multiple site renames are processed in
parallel. Prioritized sites have a much higher chance of completing first.

You must be at least a SharePoint administrator to run the cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
Set-SPOTenantRenameSitePrioritization -SiteUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/projectx
```

This example prioritizes the 'projectx' site within the Advanced Tenant Rename.

## PARAMETERS

### -SiteUrl

Specifies the full site URL of the site you wish to prioritize. This can be either a OneDrive for
Business or SharePoint Online site. Root URLs (e.g., contoso.sharepoint.com,
contoso-admin.sharepoint.com or contoso-my.sharepoint.com) can't be prioritized.
