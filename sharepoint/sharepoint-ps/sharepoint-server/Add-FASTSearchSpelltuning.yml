  This                                             cmdlet activates alignment of the spell checking dictionary with the index, so that spell checking dictionaries are built from content that is fed into the index (not from standardized spelling dictionaries).

  The Did You Mean feature is dictionary based; when spell tuning is activated, Did You Mean only suggests terms that are actually in the index.
