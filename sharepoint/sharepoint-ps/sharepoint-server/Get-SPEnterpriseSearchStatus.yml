parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  This cmdlet retrieves diagnostic information for all or specified search components in the active topology of a Search Service Application.

  If you don't specify any of the optional parameters, the cmdlet will retrieve the health status of all the search components within the Search Service Application.
  Each search component will have one of the following states:

  - Active: The search component is running OK
  - Degraded: The search component is in a status where it cannot perform all operations correctly.  The reason for the degraded status is typically a transient situation related to a restart or network issues.
  - Failed: The search component is not running.  This status indicated that the component cannot perform operations correctly.
  - Unknown:  The component can't be reached.  The reason for the unknown status is typically hardware or communication issues.

  If you have defined more than one Index component for a partition in your search topology, this cmdlet will indicate which index component that has the Primary role for this partition.

  You can use the cmdlet to output the following additional information:

  - List the status of background activities (batch jobs) initiated by the search components
  - List the status of background activities (batch jobs) initiated by the search components
  - List detailed diagnostic information for the index component
  - Debug information that may be used by Microsoft for detailed issue resolution

  If you don't want to iterate over the output in a script, use the Text parameter. 
  If you do not use the Text parameter, the cmdlet will output a set of objects that have the following properties:

  - string Name: the name of a search component, a health report item or a constellation property
  - string State: the status of the search component
  - string Level: when you are using the HealthReport parameter, this property indicates the importance level of each health report item (Error, Warning, Info, Verbose)
  - string Message: additional information that is provided as a text string
  - ReadOnlyDictionary\<string,string\>Details: dictionary name/value pairs that provide additional diagnostic information
