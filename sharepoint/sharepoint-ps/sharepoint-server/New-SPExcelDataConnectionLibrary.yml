parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Address
  isRequired: true

    Specifies the address of the data connection library.
    The address must be unique in the list of trusted data connection libraries.

    The type must be a valid URL, in the form https://server_name.

- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `New-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary` cmdlet adds a data connection library to the list of trusted data connection libraries for an Excel Services Application Web service application. 
  Excel Services Application loads only data connection files that are stored in a data connection library that is on the list of trusted data connection libraries.
  Data connection libraries contain data connection files, which contain all the resources that Excel Services Application and the Excel client require to connect to an external data source.
  Data connection libraries enable you to reuse and share data connections.
  Data connections can be loaded by using information from the workbook file; however, using a data connection library to load data connections allows data connections to be managed separately from workbooks.
