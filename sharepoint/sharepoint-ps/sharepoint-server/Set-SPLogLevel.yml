parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `Set-SPLogLevel` cmdlet sets the Windows event logging and trace logging levels for one or more diagnostic logging categories registered in the farm.
  If an event or trace associated with a category occurs, but is less severe than that category's logging level, the event or trace is not written to the event log or the trace log.
  If an event or trace associated with a category occurs and is equally severe or more severe than that category's logging level, the event or trace is written to the event log or the trace log.
