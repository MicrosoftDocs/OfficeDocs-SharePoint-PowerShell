parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `Set-SPExcelDataProvider` cmdlet sets the properties of a data provider that is stored in the list of safe data providers.
  Excel Services Application refreshes external data connections only if the data provider for that connection is in the list of safe data providers. 
  Excel Services Application include a set of common data providers in this list.
  Therefore, using cmdlets to modify safe data providers is typically an operation of custom data connection scenarios.
