  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    NOTE: When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  The Update-SPHelp cmdlet checks the Windows Download Center for updates for the SharePoint Management Shell help files against the version of the help files on the local computer. If there updates available, the cmdlet will download and install these updates. By default, the cmdlet will allow checking for updates only once every 24 hours. To override this check, use the Force parameter.

  The computer that the cmdlet is being run on must have an internet connection.

  Note: This cmdlet currently does not update cmdlet help.
