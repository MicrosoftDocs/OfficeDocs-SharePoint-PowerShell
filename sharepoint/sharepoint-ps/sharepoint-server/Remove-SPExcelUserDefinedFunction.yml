  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  The `Remove-SPExcelUserDefinedFunction` cmdlet removes a user-defined function from the list of user-defined functions.
  User-defined functions are managed code assemblies that can be called from an Excel Services Application workbook by using standard Excel Services Application formula syntax.
  The assemblies can perform custom logic or other actions, such as refresh data.
  The Windows PowerShell cmdlets operate on the entries in the user-defined function list, but do not operate on the assemblies.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).
