  This cmdlet gets troubleshooting information for group expansions and aliaser processing performed to create the user search security filter.

  The group expansion information contains the user, expanded groups that contain the user (i.e., the user is a member of the group), and all groups that contain other expanded groups.

  The aliaser procession information contains all mapped to users and groups based on the regular expression and XML aliaser mapping definitions.
