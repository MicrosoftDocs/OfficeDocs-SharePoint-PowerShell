parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AbortOnRefreshOnOpenFail
  description: |+
    Specifies that the load of a Excel Services Application file automatically fails if an automatic data refresh operation fails when the file is opened.
    The load is failed only if the following conditions are true:

    -- User has read-only permissions to the Excel Services Application file.
    -- Workbook file has data connections that refresh automatically when the Excel file is opened.

    System.String

    Specifies a Web folder, or file directory from which Excel Services Application can load workbooks.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

name: Set-SPExcelFileLocation
description: |-
  The `Set-SPExcelFileLocation` cmdlet sets properties of a location from which Excel Services Application loads workbooks.
  Excel Services Application  loads only workbooks that are stored in a trusted file location.
  Properties of trusted file locations control how workbooks can be used when they are loaded on Excel Services Application.
  Excel Services Application always enforces the properties that are defined by the trusted file location from which a workbook was loaded.
  The properties that are used by the trusted file location are determined by comparison of the file path for the workbook with the Address parameter of the trusted file location.
