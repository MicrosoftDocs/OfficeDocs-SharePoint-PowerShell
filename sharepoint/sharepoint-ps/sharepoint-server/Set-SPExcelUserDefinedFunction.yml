parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Assembly
  description: |+
    Specifies the strongly-typed name of the assembly.
    The name must be unique in the list of user-defined functions and cannot be more than 4096 alphanumeric characters long.

    The type must be a string of alphanumeric characters; for example, SampleCompany.SampleApplication.SampleUdf, C:\UDFs\SampleUdf.dll, or \\\\MyNetworkServer\UDFs\SampleUdf.dll.


  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="AssemblyLocation" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssemblyLocation
  description: |+
    Specifies the location where the assembly is stored.

    The type must be one of the following: GAC or LocalFile.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `Set-SPExcelUserDefinedFunction` cmdlet sets properties of a user-defined function assembly. 
  Excel Services Application uses only user-defined functions that have an entry in the user-defined function list.
  User-defined functions are managed code assemblies that can be called from an Excel Services Application workbook by using standard Excel Services Application formula syntax.
  The assemblies can perform custom logic or other actions, such as refresh data.
  Windows PowerShell cmdlets operate on the entries in the user-defined function list and do not operate on the assemblies.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).
