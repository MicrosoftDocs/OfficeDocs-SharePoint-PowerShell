parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  name: Confirm

    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExcludeWebApplications
  description: |+
    Comma-delimited list of Web application URLs to exclude from consideration in the synchronization process.

    The values specified delete any existing values set.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Boolean" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IgnoreIsActive
  description: |+
    Specifies whether to sync only active profiles or all profiles.
    User profiles of users who contribute to the site are considered as Active.

    The valid values are True or False.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "4"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SweepTiming
  description: |+
    Performs the same tasks as the SynchronizationTiming parameter.
    However, the SweepTiming parameter sets the schedule for the "sweep" job.
    The sweep job is driven by the SharePoint Foundation change log and is used as a lightweight way to capture new users added.
    For example, you might have a fully synchronized site, but then a user is added to the site.
    The sweep job ensures that the incremental newly added user gets the User Profile properties replicated quickly.

    The default value is every 1 minute.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SynchronizationTiming
  description: |+
    Sets the schedule for the main synchronization job.
    You can mention the schedule using a text string of SPSchedule format (for example, "every 15 minutes" means the job is scheduled to run every 15 minutes, "daily at 09:00:00" means the job is scheduled to run at 9 AM every day).

    The default is once per hour.

    You can use the SPSchedule.FromString() string method to pass in the strings, "every 5 minutes" or "weekly xxxxxxx".

  defaultValue: None
