  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `Remove-SPExcelFileLocation` cmdlet removes a location from the list of trusted file locations.
  Excel Services Application loads only workbooks that are stored in a trusted file location.
  Properties of trusted file locations control how workbooks can be used when loaded on Excel Services Application. 
  Excel Services Application always enforces the properties defined by the trusted file location from which a workbook was loaded.
  The properties used by the trusted file location are determined by comparing the file path for the workbook with the Address parameter of the trusted file location.
