  summary: ""
parameters:

  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The Disable-SPSessionStateService cmdlet turns off the session state service.
  If your farm does not depend on session state service, we recommend that you disable it.

  When session state is disabled, some SharePoint Server services, components, and third-party components no longer function.
  Changing this property modifies the Web.config file on every content Web application on every server in the farm.
