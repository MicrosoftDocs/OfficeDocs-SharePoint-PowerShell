  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  Use the `Remove-SPShellAdmin` cmdlet to remove a user from the SharePoint_Shell_Access role in a specified database.

  When you use this cmdlet to remove a user from the role, you do not remove the user from the WSS_ADMIN_WPG group in the target database.

  When you run this cmdlet to add a user to the SharePoint_Shell_Access role, the user must have the following security permissions:

  - Security_Admin role access on the instance of SQL Server and the db_owner role in the database.
  - Administrative permission to the local computer.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).
