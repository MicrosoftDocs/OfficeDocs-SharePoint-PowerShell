parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  Use the Copy-SPSite cmdlet to make a copy of a site collection from an implied source content database to a specified destination content database.

  The copy of the site collection has a new URL and a new SiteID.
  When you have database snapshot capabilities on a computer runningSQL Server, a temporary snapshot of the source database is created for the duration of the copy to prevent any data changes during the copy process.
  If you do not have database snapshot capabilities on the server running SQL Server, you can back up the source and restore it to the destination to get the same result.
