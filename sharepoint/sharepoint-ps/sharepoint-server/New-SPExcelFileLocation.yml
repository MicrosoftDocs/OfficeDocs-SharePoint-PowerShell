    This example adds a new trusted file location to the list of trusted file locations that is in the Excel Services Application Web service application named MyExcelService.

    This example enables workbooks to load from any child or subfolder that starts with https://myPortal/myTeam.
    All workbooks loaded from this location must be smaller than 50 megabytes (MB) in size.
    The workbooks can refresh external data by using connections that are embedded in the workbook file or stored in a data connection library.
    A warning message that the workbook is attempting to refresh external data will not be displayed.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AbortOnRefreshOnOpenFail
  description: |+
    Specifies that the loading of a Excel Services Application file automatically fails if an automatic data refresh operation fails when the file is opened.
    The load is failed only if the following conditions are true:

    - The user has SharePoint Product and Technologies read-only permissions to the file.
    - The workbook file has data connections that are refreshed automatically when the Excel Services Application file is opened.

  defaultValue: None

  name: Address
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a Web folder, or file directory from which Excel Services Application can load workbooks.

    The type must be a valid URL, in the form https://myPortal/myTeam; or a valid UNC path in form, \\\\server_name\folder_name

- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `New-SPExcelFileLocation` cmdlet adds a new location to the list of trusted file locations in an Excel Services Application Web service application. 
  Excel Services Application loads only workbooks that are stored in a trusted file location.
  Properties of trusted file locations control how workbooks can be used when loaded on Excel Services Application.
  Excel Services Application always enforces the properties defined by the trusted file location from which a workbook was loaded.
  The properties that the trusted file location uses are determined through comparison of the file path for the workbook with the Address parameter of the trusted file location.

  The longest match takes precedence.
  For example, if https://portal/site/ and https://portal/site/subsite are trusted locations and you load a workbook from the subsite, the application uses the properties from the subsite trusted location because it has the longest matching address.
