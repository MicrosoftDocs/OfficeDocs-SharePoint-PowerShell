  code: |-
    Set-FASTSearchMetadataCategory -Name Titles -DiscoverNewProperties 1 -MapToContents 1
  description: |-
    With this example, all new crawled properties for the category "Titles" are automatically discovered and added to the category.
    A crawled property is considered a member of the category if it has the same property set as the category.

    This example also sets MapToContents so that new crawled properties are mapped to the "content" full text index.
    If you do not want a newly discovered crawled property made available through the full text index, override this action by setting the specific crawled property's IsMappedToContents parameter to false.

  This cmdlet changes the settings of a crawled property category.
  A category is a group of crawled properties, and the properties of the category control the default behavior of the member crawled properties.

  If MapToContents is set to "true" on a crawled property category, new crawled properties added to a category are mapped to the "content" full text index.
  The names of the crawled properties mapped to the "content" full text index are added to the crawledpropertynames managed property.
  You can override this action by setting the crawled property's IsMappedToContents parameter to "false".

  You can call the cmdlet with either the name of the category (Name parameter), or with a category object (Category parameter).

  You can also use the cmdlet to rename a category.

  You can only map a crawled property to one category at a time.
