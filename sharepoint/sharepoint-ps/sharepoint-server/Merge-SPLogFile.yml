  name: Area
  description: |+

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The Merge-SPLogFile cmdlet returns records from Unified Logging Service (ULS) trace log files on each farm server that match the criteria, and writes the results to a new log file on the local computer.
  If no results are returned, a warning is written to the Windows PowerShell console window.

  We recommend that you filter by using the StartTime and EndTime parameters to optimize performance of this cmdlet.
  Some filtering parameters such as Process, Area, Category, EventID and Message support wildcards.
