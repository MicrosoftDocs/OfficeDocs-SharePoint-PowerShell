    Specifies the address of the data connection library.
    The address must be unique in the list of trusted data connection libraries.

    The type must be a valid URL, in the form https://server_name.

- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `Set-SPExcelDataConnectionLibrary` cmdlet sets the properties of a library from which Excel Services Application loads data connection files.
  Excel Services Application loads data connection files only if they are stored in a data connection library that is on the list of trusted data connection libraries.
  Data connection libraries constitute a kind of list that contains data connection files.
  These files contain everything that Excel Services Application and the Excel client require to connect to an external data source.
  Data connection libraries enable you to reuse and share data connections.
  Data connections can be loaded by using information from the workbook file.
  However, using a data connection library to load data connections provides an additional layer for data connections so that they can be managed separately from workbooks.
