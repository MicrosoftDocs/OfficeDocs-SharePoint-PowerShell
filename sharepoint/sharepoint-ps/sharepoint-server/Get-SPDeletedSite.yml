parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
  You may only use parameters from one parameter set, and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
  For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet parameter sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-parameter-sets).

  This cmdlet was introduced in SharePoint Server with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and SharePoint Foundation with Service Pack 1 (SP1).

  Use the Get-SPDeletedSite cmdlet to display a list of deleted site collections by using the Identity parameter.
  If no parameter is specified, then all deleted site collections in the farm are displayed. Deleted Sites are sites in the process of gradual delete. For more information on gradual delete, see [Remove-SPSite](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-server/remove-spsite?view=sharepoint-ps).

  Unlike the Get-SPSite cmdlet that uses the host name and scheme for the Identity parameter (that is, https://server_name), the value of the identity parameter for all SPDeletedSite cmdlets use a server-relative URL.
  Typically, the forward slash character (/) begins the relative URL and also denotes the root site.

  For additional information about a server-relative URL or understanding general concepts about absolute and relative URLs, see Server-relative URL Property (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spsite.serverrelativeurl.aspx) or Understanding Absolute and Relative URL Addresses (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb208688(office.12).aspx).
