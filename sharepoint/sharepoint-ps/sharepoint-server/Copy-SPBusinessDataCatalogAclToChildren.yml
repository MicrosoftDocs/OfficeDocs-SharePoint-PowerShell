  code: |-
    $ExternalSystem = Get-SPBusinessDataCatalogMetadataObject -BdcObjectType "LobSystem" -ServiceContext https://contoso -Name "ContosoDatabase"
  description: |-
    This example looks at the principals (users) and their corresponding rights given for the External System metadata object, and overwrites the permissions of its child metadata objects with these same principals and rights.

    Any principals and their rights will be lost from the child metadata objects.
    Make sure that the parent metadata object has the final permissions you want, or make sure to append them to the child object again after you run this cmdlet.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
