  code: |-
    Start-SPAssignment -global
    $w = Get-SPWeb https://MyWeb
    $w | Set-SPWeb -title "Accounting"
    Stop-SPAssignment -global
  description: |-
    This example uses simple assignment.
    While easier to use simple assignment, running commands that iterate through multiple SPSite or SPWeb objects while simple assignment is enabled is not recommended.
    Ensure that `Stop-SPAssignment` is run before attempting any iterations of multiple objects.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  The `Stop-SPAssignment` cmdlet disposes of objects in the provided assignment collection.
  Use the Global parameter to dispose of all objects in the global assignment collector and to stop the global store from collecting additional objects.
  Provide a SemiGlobal assignment collector to dispose of all contained objects.
