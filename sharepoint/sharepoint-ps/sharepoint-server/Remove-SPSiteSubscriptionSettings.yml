  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
  You may only use parameters from one parameter set and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
  For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet parameter sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-parameter-sets).

  The `Remove-SPSiteSubscriptionSettings` cmdlet deletes site subscription stored data for the specified site subscription.
  If the FindAllOrphans parameter is specified, this cmdlet locates any data in the service application that does not exist in the list of local site subscriptions or the alternate list of subscriptions.

  The set of site subscriptions can be specified directly, or discovered by comparing data in the service application to the set of existing site subscriptions which finds the data set that corresponds to nonexistent site subscriptions.

  If this cmdlet is run on a federated service application without specifying the complete list of site subscription IDs for the AlternativeSiteSubscriptions parameter, data loss can result.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).
