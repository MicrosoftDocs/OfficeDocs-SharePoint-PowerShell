  name: Assembly
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the strongly typed name of the assembly.
    The name must be unique in the list of user-defined functions.
    The name can be a maximum of 4096 alphanumeric characters.

    The type must be a string of alphanumeric characters; for example:

  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `New-SPExcelUserDefinedFunction` cmdlet adds a user-defined function to an Excel Services Application Web service application. 
  Excel Services Application uses only user-defined functions that have an entry in the list of user-defined functions.
  User-defined functions are managed code assemblies that can be called from an Excel Services Application workbook by using standard  Excel Services Application formula syntax.
  The assemblies can perform custom logic or other actions, such as refresh data.
  Windows PowerShell cmdlets operate on the entries that are in the list of user-defined functions, but they do not operate on the assemblies.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).
