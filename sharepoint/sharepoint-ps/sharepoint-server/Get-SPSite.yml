  code: |-
    Get-SPSite -ContentDatabase "b399a366-d899-4cff-8a9b-8c0594ee755f" | Format-Table -Property Url, Owner, SecondaryOwner
  description: |-

  summary: ""
- title: '------------------EXAMPLE 3---------------------'
  code: |-
    Start-SPAssignment -Global

    $s = Get-SPSite -Identity https://<MyApp>/Sites/Site1

    $s.Url

    Stop-SPAssignment -Global
  description: |-
    This example gets the sites specified by the Identity parameter and inserts the results in the variable s

    The previous example uses the Global method of assignment collection.
    The Global method is easy to use but the contents of this object grows quickly.
    Be careful not to run a Get-SPSite command that returns many results while global assignment is enabled.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
  You may only use parameters from one parameter set, and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
  For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet parameter sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-parameter-sets).

  The Get-SPSite cmdlet returns either a single site that matches the Identity parameter, or all the sites that match the Filter parameter for the specified scope.
  The scopes are the WebApplication, ContentDatabase , and SiteSubscription parameters.
  If none of these scopes is provided, the scope is the farm.
  If the scope is specified with no Filter parameter, all sites in that scope are returned.

  The Identity parameter supports providing a partial URL that ends in a wildcard character (*).
  All site collections that match this partial URL for the specified scope are returned.
  Additionally, if the Regex parameter is provided, the Identity parameter is treated as a regular expression and any site collection with a URL provided in the given scope that matches the expression is returned.

  The Filter parameter is a server-side filter for certain site collection properties that are stored in the content database; without the Filter parameter, filtering on these properties is a slow process.
  These site collection properties are Owner, SecondaryOwner, and LockState.
  The Filter parameter is a script block that uses the same syntax as a Where-Object statement, but is run on the server for faster results.

  Valid values for LockState are: Unlock, NoAdditions, ReadOnly, NoAccess.

  It is important to note that every site collection that the Get-SPSite cmdlet returns is automatically destroyed at the end of the pipeline.
  To store the results of Get-SPSite in a local variable, use the Start-SPAssignment and Stop-SPAssignment cmdlets to avoid memory leaks.
