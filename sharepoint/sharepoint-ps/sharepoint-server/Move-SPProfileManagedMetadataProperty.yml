parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  name: AvailableForTagging
  description: |+
    Determines whether the terms in the resulting term set can be used for Managed Metadata tagging.
    If a term set has more than 30,000 terms, using it for Managed Metadata tagging may lead to performance issues on the client computer.
    Because a majority of the profile properties may have more than 30,000 terms, the default value is No.

description: |-
  Use the Move-SPProfileManagedMetadataProperty cmdlet to move multiple-string or single-string property values into a term set that you specify.
  If you do not specify a term set, the values are moved into the Keywords term set.
  Any new values you add to the property after running the cmdlet will be moved into the term set that you specified.

  After a user profile application has been upgraded from Office SharePoint Server, single-string and multiple-string value properties are not available for use unless the Move-SPProfileManagedMetadataProperty cmdlet is run to map them to term sets within Managed Metadata Service.
