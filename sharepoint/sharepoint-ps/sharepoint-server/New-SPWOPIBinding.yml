parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Action
  description: |+
    Specifies the action to bind.

    For example, "view," "edit," and "embedview." For a list of actions that the WOPI application supports, run `Get-SPWOPIBinding`.
    Typically, you will not use this parameter.

    If you specify some actions but not others, some SharePoint features may not work.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - SharePoint Server 2013
  - SharePoint Server 2016
  - SharePoint Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowHTTP
  description: |+
    Specifies that the cmdlet can use HTTP for discovery of what the WOPI application supports.

    If this is specified as True, the discovery information from the WOPI application will be sent on a nonsecure connection.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - SharePoint Server 2013
  - SharePoint Server 2016
  - SharePoint Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Application
  description: |+
    Specifies applications to bind.

    Possible applications are as follows: "Word," "Excel," "PowerPoint," or "OneNote." Run `Get-SPWOPIBinding` to get the full list of application the WOPI application supports.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - SharePoint Server 2013
  - SharePoint Server 2016
  - SharePoint Server 2019
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  defaultValue: None

description: |-
  The `New-SPWOPIBinding` cmdlet associates file name extensions or applications to actions on the current SharePoint farm where this cmdlet is run.
  Each binding allows you to use the WOPI application to view or edit files in your SharePoint library.
  For example, when a user sees a Word document in a SharePoint document list, the SharePoint list will display the available options to view or edit the document based on the actions that are bound to Word on that SharePoint farm.

  To use a WOPI application, such as a server that runs Office Web Apps Server, for Office Web Apps, you must run this cmdlet on the SharePoint farm before you can use the Office Web Apps.

  If you run `New-SPWOPIBinding` for an application or file name extension where the binding (or association) already exists, the cmdlet will fail.
