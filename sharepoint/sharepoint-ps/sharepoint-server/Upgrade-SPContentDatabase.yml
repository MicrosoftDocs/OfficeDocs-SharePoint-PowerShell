parameters:

  name: AllowUnattached
  description: |+

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

    A failed upgrade reverts the database to its state when the snapshot was taken.

    This parameter only works for versions of SQL Server that support creation and use of snapshots, for example, SQL ServerEnterprise edition.

  This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
  You may only use parameters from one parameter set and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
  For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet Parameter Sets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=187810).

  Use the `Upgrade-SPContentDatabase` cmdlet to resume a failed database upgrade or begin a build-to-build database upgrade against a SharePoint content database.
  The `Upgrade-SPContentDatabase` cmdlet initiates an upgrade of an existing content database that is attached to the current farm.
  This cmdlet begins a new upgrade session, which can be used either to resume a failed version-to-version or build-to-build upgrade of a content database or to begin a build-to-build upgrade of a content database.

  If the database is hosted on a version of SQL Server that supports creation and use of snapshots of the database, this cmdlet can use a database snapshot for build-to-build upgrades. 
  During upgrade, users see a ready-only version of the database, which is the snapshot.
  After upgrade users see upgraded content.

  The default behavior of this cmdlet causes an upgrade of the schema of the database and initiates build-to-build upgrades for all site collections within the specified content database if required.
  To prevent build-to-build upgrades of site collections, use the NoB2BSiteUpgrade parameter.

  This cmdlet does not trigger version-to-version upgrade of any site collections.
