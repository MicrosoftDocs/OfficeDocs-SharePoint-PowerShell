  description: |-
    This example lists all potential matches to a named crawled property, and then selects the exact crawled property by iterating over the result set and picking out the result that also matches both the requested property set and variant type.
    The command returns the "url" crawled property in the "Enterprise Crawler" category.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Count
  description: |+
    The maximum number of crawled properties to return (starting from the first returned crawled property, or from the index given by the Offset parameter).

    If the Filter or Name parameter is specified, these will only be applied after the result set has been narrowed down to the range \[Offset, Offset + Count\].

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - FAST Server for SharePoint 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    The term used to search for configured crawled properties.

    The Filter parameter does not support wildcards.
    Matching is case-insensitive, and matches a string anywhere within the name attribute of the crawled property.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - FAST Server for SharePoint 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Name
  description: |+
    The name of crawled property to retrieve.

    The Name parameter supports wildcards.
    Combine the Name parameter with the Offset and Count parameters to control the range that is searched.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - FAST Server for SharePoint 2010
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Offset
  description: |+
    The offset in the result set from which to start returning results.

description: |-
  This cmdlet retrieves a crawled property from the FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint system.
  If the cmdlet is called without any parameters, it returns all crawled properties in the system.
  The order of the returned crawled property list is fixed, and multiple calls return the same ordered list as long as no new crawled properties have been added.

  Get-FASTSearchMetadataCrawledProperty supports several ways of looking up properties.
  Run with a single parameter or with a named parameter (using Name), the cmdlet retrieves crawled properties with that exact name, if any exist.
  The Name parameter supports wildcards.
  Alternatively, a filter can be specified (using the Filter parameter) to search the crawled properties and to return any crawled property with a name that includes the filter value.
  The filter option does not support wildcards.

  Retrieving crawled properties with the Filter parameter is much more efficient than using the Name parameter.

  To paginate a set of results from this cmdlet, use an Offset and Count to control the number of returned results.

  Offset and Count are calculated before either filter or named matching is done.
  This means that if a crawled property falls outside the \[Offset,Offset+Count\] range, it will not be returned.
