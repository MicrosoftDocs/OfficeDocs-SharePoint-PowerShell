  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

    Specifies the name of the user agent to receive InfoPath 2013 files.
    These user agents represent search bots that are commonly used in an enterprise environment.
    If a different search technology is being used and InfoPath 2013 files are not being indexed, you can add additional search bots for that technology to the collection.

    The type must be a valid file name; for example UserAgentName1.

  The Add-SPInfoPathUserAgent cmdlet creates a user agent to receive the .xml file that contains the data of the form for indexing.
