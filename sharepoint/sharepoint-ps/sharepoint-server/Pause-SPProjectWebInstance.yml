parameters:

  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  Switches the specified instance of Project Web App to read-only, preventing any changes from being made through the Project Server Interface (PSI) or Client Server Object Model (CSOM). While in this state the database is not actually read-only and the Queue service can still write to the database, but it will not pick up any new jobs to process. This cmdlet is used to allow the queue to empty out before an administrator switches the database to read-only.
