parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The Get-SPExcelDataProvider cmdlet reads a safe data provider or a list of safe data providers for an Excel Services Application.
  Excel Services Application refreshes external data connections only if the data provider for the connection is on the list of safe data providers.
  Excel Services Application includes a set of common data providers on this list.
  Therefore, using cmdlets to modify safe data providers is typically done only in custom data connection scenarios.
