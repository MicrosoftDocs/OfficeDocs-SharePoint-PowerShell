  This cmdlet disables the alignment of the spell check dictionaries with indexed content.
  This cmdlet stops the generation of new dictionaries, and the Did You Mean feature will only use content that was fed into the index before this cmdlet was run.

  After disabling the dictionary-index alignment, use the                                             Reset-FASTSearchSpelltuning cmdlet to return to the out-of-the-box spelling dictionaries.
  Did You Mean will then make suggestions based on standard spell checking dictionaries, not on indexed content.
