  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
  You may only use parameters from one parameter set and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
  For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet parameter sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-parameter-sets).

  The `New-SPManagedPath` cmdlet adds a new managed path to a given Web application or for use with all host header site collections.
  If the HostHeader switch is provided, the managed path is shared among all host-named site collections; otherwise, a Web application must be specified to create this managed path within.
  The relative URL is a partial URL that represents the managed path.
  When the slash mark (/) is used, the root is defined.
  If the Explicit parameter is not provided, the new managed path is a wildcard path.
