  name: SignInAccelerationDomain
  description: |+
    Specifies the home realm discovery value to be sent to Azure Active Directory (AAD) during the user sign-in process.

    When the organization uses a third-party identity provider, this prevents the user from seeing the Azure Active Directory Home Realm Discovery web page and ensures the user only sees their company's Identity Provider's portal.
    This value can also be used with Azure Active Directory Premium to customize the Azure Active Directory login page.

    Acceleration will not occur on site collections that are shared externally.

    This value should be configured with the login domain that is used by your company (that is, example@contoso.com).

    If your company has multiple third-party identity providers, configuring the sign-in acceleration value will break sign-in for your organization.

    The valid values are:
    "" (default) - Blank by default, this will also remove or clear any value that has been set.
    Login Domain - For example: "contoso.com"

  name: UsePersistentCookiesForExplorerView

    Lets SharePoint issue a special cookie that will allow this feature to work even when "Keep Me Signed In" is not selected.

    "Open with Explorer" requires persisted cookies to operate correctly.
    When the user does not select "Keep Me Signed in" at the time of sign -in, "Open with Explorer" will fail.

    This special cookie expires after 30 minutes and cannot be cleared by closing the browser or signing out of SharePoint Online.To clear this cookie, the user must log out of their Windows session.

    The valid values are:
    False(default) - No special cookie is generated and the normal Office 365 sign -in length / timing applies.
    True - Generates a special cookie that will allow "Open with Explorer" to function if the "Keep Me Signed In" box is not checked at sign -in.
