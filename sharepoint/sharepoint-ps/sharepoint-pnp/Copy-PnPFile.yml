  Copies a file or folder to a different location. This location can be within the same document library, same site, same site collection or even to another site collection on the same tenant. Currently there is a 200MB file size limit for the file or folder to be copied. Notice that if copying between sites or to a subsite you cannot specify a target filename, only a folder name.
