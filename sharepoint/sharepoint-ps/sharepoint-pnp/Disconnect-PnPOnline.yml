  >Note: in general it is not recommended nor needed to use this cmdlet.

  Disconnects the current context and requires you to build up a new connection in order to use the Cmdlets again. Using Connect-PnPOnline to connect to a different site has the same effect and it's rarely needed to use Disconnect-PnPOnline. Notice that if you use Disconnect-PnPOnline the internal access token cache will be cleared too. This means that if you loop through many Connect-PnPOnline and subsequent Disconnect-PnPOnline statements a full request to the Azure AD is being made to acquire a token. This will cause throttling to occur and the script will stop.
