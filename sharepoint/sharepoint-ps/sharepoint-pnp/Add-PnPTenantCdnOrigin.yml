    Relative-Relative path depends on the OriginScope. If the originScope is Tenant, a path must be a relative path under the tenant root. If the originScope is Site, a path must be a relative path under the given Site. The path must point to the valid Document Library or a folder with a document library.

description: |-
  Add a new origin to the public or private CDN, on either Tenant level or on a single Site level. Effectively, a tenant admin points out to a document library, or a folder in the document library and requests that content in that library should be retrievable by using a CDN.

  You must be a SharePoint Online global administrator and a site collection administrator to run the cmdlet.
