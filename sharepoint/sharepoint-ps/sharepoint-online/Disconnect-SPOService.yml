  The `Disconnect-SPOService` cmdlet explicitly disconnects a previously created SharePoint Online service connection.

  Global administrators can disconnect the service by running the `Disconnect-SPOService` cmdlet or by running the `Connect-SPOService` cmdlet to initiate another connection.
  For more information, see `Connect-SPOService`.

  Even after a connection is terminated, operations that were started before the connection is terminated will run to completion.
  In other words, long-running operations will not be terminated by running the `Disconnect-SPOService` cmdlet or the `Connect-SPOService` cmdlet.

  You must be a SharePoint Online administrator or Global Administrator to run the cmdlet.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Online, see the online documentation at [Intro to SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell?view=sharepoint-ps).
