description: |-
  Swaps the location of a source site with a target site while archiving the original target site.

  Please note, the target site must be either:

  - The root site, for example <https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com>; or
  - The search center site, for example <https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/search>.

  When the swap is initiated, the target site is moved to the archive location and the source site is moved to the target location. By default, a site redirect is created at the source location that will redirect traffic to the target location.

  If the target is the root site at <https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com>, then the following preparation activities should be performed prior to performing the swap:

  1. Any Featured links defined in SharePoint Start Page at <https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx> will not be displayed after performing the swap. If required, the Featured links should be documented so they can be manually recreated after the swap.
  2. Functionality such as external sharing and application interfaces are dependent on the policies and permissions defined at the root site. Review the source site to ensure that it has the required policies and permissions as per the existing root site. This includes external sharing settings as well as site permissions.
  3. Larger tenants that have more than ~10,000 licenses will need to run the [Page Diagnostic Tool](/office365/enterprise/page-diagnostics-for-spo) against the source site (ensure that the user running the Page Diagnostic Tool has edit rights on the source site). Any analysis results that have the category Attention required (Red) or Improvement opportunities (Orange) will need to be remediated before performing the swap. 

  The source and target sites can't be connected to an Office 365 group. They also can't be hub sites or associated with a hub.
  If a site is a hub site, unregister it as a hub site, swap the root site, and then register the site as a hub site. If a site is associated with a hub, disassociate the site, swap the root site, and then reassociate the site.

  If the Publishing feature has previously been activated or is currently activated on the source site, Invoke-SPOSiteSwap cannot be used.
