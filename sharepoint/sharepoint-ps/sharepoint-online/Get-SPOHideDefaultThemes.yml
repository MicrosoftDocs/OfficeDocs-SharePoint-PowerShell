  The **Get-SPOHideDefaultThemes** cmdlet retrieves the current **Set-SPOHideDefaultThemes** setting. You might want to use this cmdlet in a PowerShell script to read the setting and then take different actions based on whether the default themes are hidden. This cmdlet does not have any parameters.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This cmdlet was named **Get-HideDefaultThemes** until the December 2017 release of the SPO Management Shell. We recommend that you use the latest version of the PowerShell cmdlets.
