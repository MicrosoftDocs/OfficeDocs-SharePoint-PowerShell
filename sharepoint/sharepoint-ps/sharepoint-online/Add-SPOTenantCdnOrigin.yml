description: |-
  Configures a new origin to public or private CDN, on either Tenant level or on a single Site level. Effectively, a tenant admin points out to a document library, or a folder in the document library and requests that content in that library should be retrievable by using a CDN.

  You must have the SharePoint Admin role or Global Administrator role and be a site collection administrator to run the cmdlet.
