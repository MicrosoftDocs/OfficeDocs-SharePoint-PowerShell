# Remove-SPOContainer

## SYNOPSIS
Sends a Container to the Recycle Bin.

## SYNTAX

### ParamSet1

```powershell
Remove-SPOContainer [-Identity <ContainerId>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Remove-SPOContainer` cmdlet deletes a File Storage Container and puts it in the Recycle Bin. A Container that is deleted will no longer be retrieved by the [`Get-SPOContainer`](./Get-SPOContainer.md) cmdlet.

When admins delete a Container, it is moved into the Recycle Bin. A deleted Container can be [restored](./Restore-SPODeletedContainer.md) from the Recycle Bin within 93 days. If a Container is deleted from the Recycle Bin, or it exceeds the 93-day retention period, it is permanently deleted. Deleting a Container deletes everything within it, including all documents and files. You can view all deleted Containers in the Recycle Bin with the [`Get-SPODeletedContainer`](./Get-SPODeletedContainer.md) cmdlet.

You must be a SharePoint Online Administrator or Global Administrator to run this cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
Remove-SPOContainer -Identity 423poi45-jikl-9bnm-b302-1234ghy56789
```

Example 1 places the Container with the `ContainerId` `423poi45-jikl-9bnm-b302-1234ghy56789` into the Recycle Bin. The Container will be permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin after 93 days unless the deleted Container is [restored](./Restore-SPODeletedContainer.md) before permanent deletion. 

## PARAMETERS

Use this parameter to provide the `ContainerId` of the Container to be deleted.
