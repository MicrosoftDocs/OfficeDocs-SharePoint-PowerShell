  The `Get-SPODeletedSite` cmdlet returns all deleted site collections that match the given criteria from the Recycle Bin.

  By default the cmdlet only returns site and site collections that are not Personal Sites (My Sites).
  To include personal sites, use the IncludePersonalSite parameter.
  To return only Personal Sites, use the IncludeOnlyPersonalSite parameter.

  These two Switch Parameters are in different parameter sets, so you can only use either one of them but not both.

  This action does not restore these returned sites or site collection.
  It only returns their properties so that you can see what sites or site collections have been deleted.
  To restore the site or site collections, forward the results to the `Restore-SPODeletedSite` cmdlet in the pipeline.

  You must be a SharePoint Online administrator and be a site collection administrator for the deleted site collections to run the cmdlet.
