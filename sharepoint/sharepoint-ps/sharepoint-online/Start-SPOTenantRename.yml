### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This feature is currently available to organizations that have no more than 10,000 total SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts combined.  Additionally, tenant renaming capability is not available for GCC, GCC High, and DoD.

  Starts a job to change the SharePoint domain name for your organization in Microsoft 365. For example, if the name of your organization changes from "Contoso" to "Fabrikam," you can change contoso.sharepoint.com to fabrikam.sharepoint.com.

  > [!WARNING]
  > Changing your SharePoint domain name might take several hours to days depending on the number of sites and OneDrive users that you have. We strongly recommend that you make this change during a period of low usage (like a weekend) and tell users to avoid accessing SharePoint and OneDrive content during the change. In addition, any actions that create new OneDrives and sites (such as creating a new team or private channel in Microsoft Teams) will be temporarily blocked during the rename.
