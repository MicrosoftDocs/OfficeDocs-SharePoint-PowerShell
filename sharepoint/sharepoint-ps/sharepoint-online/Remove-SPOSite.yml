  The `Remove-SPOSite` cmdlet does not delete a site collection from the site collections list permanently.
  Instead, the removed site collection is moved to the Recycle Bin.
  You can use the `Restore-SPODeletedSite`cmdlet to restore a site collection from the Recycle Bin.
  To delete a site collection permanently, first move the site collection to the Recycle Bin by using the `Remove-SPOSite` cmdlet and then delete it from the Recycle Bin by using the `Remove-SPODeletedSite` cmdlet.

  You must be at least a SharePoint Online administrator and be a site collection administrator to run the cmdlet.
