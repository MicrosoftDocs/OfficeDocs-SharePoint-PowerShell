  The `Upgrade-SPOSite` cmdlet activates the upgrade process for the specified SharePoint Online site collection.
  This cmdlet can also be used to resume failed upgrades.

  When upgrade is initiated, it can either be a build-to-build or version-to-version upgrade.
  The default is build-to-build upgrade.
  When in version-to-version upgrade, site collection health checks are first run in repair mode to ensure that the site collection can be upgraded successfully.

  You must be at least a SharePoint Online administrator and be a site collection administrator to run the cmdlet.
