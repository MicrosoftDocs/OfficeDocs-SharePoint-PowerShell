  The `Repair-SPOSite` cmdlet runs one or all site collection health checks on the site collection and its contents.
  This cmdlet will make changes if issues are found and automatically repairable.

  The cmdlet reports the health check rules with a summary of the results.
  The rules might not support automatic repair.
  Tests without repair mode can be initiated by running the `Test-SPOSite` cmdlet.

  You must be at least a SharePoint administrator to run the cmdlet.
