## DESCRIPTION

You can use the `Set-SPOTenant` cmdlet to enable external services and to specify the versions in which site collections can be created.
You can also use the `Set-SPOSite` cmdlet together with the `Set-SPOTenant` cmdlet to block access to a site in your organization and redirect traffic to another site.

You must be a SharePoint Online administrator or Global Administrator to run the cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team1 -LockState NoAccess
Set-SPOTenant -NoAccessRedirectUrl 'https://www.contoso.com'
```

This example blocks access to <https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team1> and redirects traffic to <https://www.contoso.com.>

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ShowEveryoneExceptExternalUsersClaim $false
```

This example hides the "Everyone Except External Users" claim in People Picker.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ShowAllUsersClaim $false
```

This example hides the "All Users" claim group in People Picker.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -UsePersistentCookiesForExplorerView $true
```

This example enables the use of special persisted cookie for Open with Explorer.

### EXAMPLE 5

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -LegacyAuthProtocolsEnabled $True
```

This example enables legacy authentication protocols on the tenant. This can help to enable login in situations where the admin users get an error like "Cannot contact web site '<https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/'> or the web site does not support SharePoint Online credentials. The response status code is 'Unauthorized'.", and the underlying error is "Access denied. Before opening files in this location, you must first browse to the web site and select the option to login automatically."

### EXAMPLE 6

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ContentTypeSyncSiteTemplatesList MySites
```

This example enables Content Type Hub to push content types to all OneDrive for Business sites. There is no change in Content Type Publishing behavior for other sites.

### EXAMPLE 7

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ContentTypeSyncSiteTemplatesList MySites -ExcludeSiteTemplate
```

This example stops publishing content types to OneDrive for Business sites.

### EXAMPLE 8

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -SearchResolveExactEmailOrUPN $true
```

This example disables starts with for all users/partial name search functionality for all SharePoint users, except SharePoint Admins.

### EXAMPLE 9

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -UseFindPeopleInPeoplePicker $true
```

This example enables tenant admins to enable ODB and SPO to respect Exchange supports Address Book Policy (ABP) policies in the people picker.

### EXAMPLE 10

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ShowPeoplePickerSuggestionsForGuestUsers $true
```

This example enables the option to search for existing guest users at Tenant Level.

Note, that some SharePoint system resources such as templates and pages are required to be shared to Everyone and this type of sharing does not expose any user data or metadata.

The valid values are:  

- True - The Everyone claim group is displayed in People Picker. This has been the default for tenants older than March 2018  
- False (default) - The Everyone claim group is hidden from the People Picker. This has become the new default for new tenants.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ShowEveryoneExceptExternalUsersClaim

Position: Named
Default value: True
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SignInAccelerationDomain

Specifies the home realm discovery value to be sent to Azure Active Directory (AAD) during the user sign-in process.

When the organization uses a third-party identity provider, this prevents the user from seeing the Azure Active Directory Home Realm Discovery web page and ensures the user only sees their company's Identity Provider's portal.
This value can also be used with Azure Active Directory Premium to customize the Azure Active Directory login page.

Acceleration will not occur on site collections that are shared externally.

This value should be configured with the login domain that is used by your company (that is, example@contoso.com).

If your company has multiple third-party identity providers, configuring the sign-in acceleration value will break sign-in for your organization.

The valid values are:  

- "" (default) - Blank by default, this will also remove or clear any value that has been set.  
- Login Domain - For example: "contoso.com"

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StartASiteFormUrl

Specifies URL of the form to load in the Start a Site dialog.

The valid values are:  

- "" (default) - Blank by default, this will also remove or clear any value that has been set.  
- Full URL - Example: "<https://contoso.sharepoint.com/path/to/form">

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UsePersistentCookiesForExplorerView
> [!NOTE]
> This setting is not used anymore with Internet Explorer (IE) retired and the parameter would be removed soon. Users need to select "Yes" when prompted for "Stay signed in?" at the time of sign-in for "View in File Explorer" to work with Microsoft Edge. 

Lets SharePoint issue a special cookie that will allow this feature to work even when "Keep Me Signed In" is not selected.

"Open with Explorer" requires persisted cookies to operate correctly.
When the user does not select "Keep Me Signed in" at the time of sign-in, "Open with Explorer" will fail.

This special cookie expires after 30 minutes and cannot be cleared by closing the browser or signing out of SharePoint Online.
To clear this cookie, the user must log out of their Windows session.

The valid values are:  

- False (default) - No special cookie is generated and the normal Office 365 sign-in length/timing applies.  
- True - Generates a special cookie that will allow "Open with Explorer" to function if the "Keep Me Signed In" box is not checked at sign-in.

Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False

PARAMVALUE: $true | $false

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online

> [!NOTE]
> Setting this value to "none" will default "get a link" to the most permissive link available (that is, if anonymous links are enabled, the default link will be anonymous access; if they are disabled then the default link will be internal.  

The valid values are:

- None - Respect the organization default sharing link type
- Direct - Sets the default sharing link for this site to the Specific people link
- Internal - Sets the default sharing link for this site to the organization link or company shareable link
- AnonymousAccess - Sets the default sharing link for this site to an Anonymous Access or Anyone link

```

### -DisabledWebPartIds

Allows administrators to prevent certain web parts from being added to pages or rendering on pages on which they were previously added. Currently, only the following web parts can be disabled in such a manner:

- Amazon Kindle: 46698648-fcd5-41fc-9526-c7f7b2ace919
- YouTube: 544dd15b-cf3c-441b-96da-004d5a8cea1d
- Twitter: f6fdf4f8-4a24-437b-a127-32e66a5dd9b4
- Embed: 490d7c76-1824-45b2-9de3-676421c997fa
- Microsoft Bookings: d24a7165-c455-4d43-8bc8-fedb04d6c1b5
- Stream: 275c0095-a77e-4f6d-a2a0-6a7626911518

To disable a specific web part, you need to enter its GUID as the parameter. You can enter multiple GUIDs by using a comma to separate them, for example Set-SPOTenant -DisabledWebPartIds 46698648-fcd5-41fc-9526-c7f7b2ace919,544dd15b-cf3c-441b-96da-004d5a8cea1d. To view a list of disabled web parts, use Get-SPOTenant to get DisabledWebPartIds.

To re-enable some disabled web parts, use the Set-SPOTenant with the -DisabledWebPartIds parameter and corresponding GUIDs that you still want to keep disabling. To re-enable all disabled web parts, use Set-SPOTenant -DisabledWebPartIds @().

```yaml
Type: Guid[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisallowInfectedFileDownload

Prevents the Download button from being displayed on the Virus Found warning page.

Accepts a value of true (enabled) to hide the Download button or false (disabled) to display the Download button. By default this feature is set to false.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisableCustomAppAuthentication

Prevents apps using an Azure Access Control (ACS) app-only access token to access SharePoint. ACS, a service of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), has been retired on November 7, 2018. This retirement does not impact the SharePoint add-in model, which uses the https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net hostname (which is not impacted by this retirement). For new tenants, apps using an ACS app-only access token are disabled by default. We recommend using the Azure AD app-only model which is modern and more secure.

This parameter has no effect and it was used to opt-out of PST files retention policy changes as communicated in MC256835 (May 2021).
Starting August 16, 2021, the service started retaining 30 days worth of versions for any PST files stored in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online team site document libraries. This change was introduced to prevent cases of previous versions of PST files quickly consuming available storage. The change only impacts previous versions of PST files stored in your document library storage. As a best practice, PST files should not be uploaded on OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online team site document libraries due to the impact on storage and network bandwidth.

### -OneDriveLoopSharingCapability

When sharing a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link that’s accessible by anyone within the organization and automatically shares the whiteboard with any in-tenant users in the meeting.

There’s an additional capability for temporary collaboration by external and shared device accounts during a meeting. This allows these users to temporarily view and collaborate on whiteboards when they’re shared in a Teams meeting, similar to PowerPoint Live sharing.

If you have the external sharing for OneDrive for Business allowed, no further action is required. If you have external sharing for OneDrive for Business disabled, you can leave it disabled but you must enable this new setting. The setting will not take effect until the SharingCapability 'ExternalUserAndGuestSharing' is also enabled at Tenant level. For more information, see [Enable Microsoft Whiteboard for your organization](https://support.microsoft.com/office/enable-microsoft-whiteboard-for-your-organization-1caaa2e2-5c18-4bdf-b878-2d98f1da4b24).

### -AllowAnonymousMeetingParticipantsToAccessWhiteboards
When you share a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link. This link is accessible by anyone within the organization. The whiteboard is also shared with any in-tenant users in the meeting. Whiteboards are shared using company-shareable links, regardless of the default setting. Support for the default sharing link type is planned.

There's more capability for temporary collaboration by external and shared device accounts during a Teams meeting. Users can temporarily view and collaborate on whiteboards that are shared in a meeting, in a similar way to PowerPoint Live sharing.

In this case, Whiteboard provides temporary viewing and collaboration on the whiteboard during the Teams meeting only. A share link isn't created and Whiteboard doesn't grant access to the file.

If you have external sharing enabled for OneDrive for Business, no further action is required.

If you restrict external sharing for OneDrive for Business, you can keep it restricted, and just enable this new setting in order for external and shared device accounts to work. For more information, see [Manage sharing for Microsoft Whiteboard](/microsoft-365/whiteboard/manage-sharing-organizations).

```yaml
Type: SharingState
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisableBackToClassic

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

### -IsEnableAppAuthPopUpEnabled

Enables or disables users in the organization to authenticate SharePoint applications using popups. 

This parameter affects the way code in SharePoint interacts with Azure AD to get tokens to access APIs. In scenarios where third-party cookies are disabled (such as Safari browsers with ITP feature enabled), any code that requires a token to access an API automatically triggers a full page refresh. When IsEnableAppAuthPopUpEnabled is set to $true, SharePoint will instead surface a popup in this scenario.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisableDocumentLibraryDefaultLabeling

If you need to, you can turn off this feature that supports a default sensitivity label for SharePoint document libraries. This is a tenant-level setting that requires you to use the Set-SPOTenant cmdlet with the DisableDocumentLibraryDefaultLabeling parameter set to True.

After you run this command, you won't see the option to configure Default sensitivity labels for a document library. You won't be able to select a default sensitivity label for new or existing libraries.

For document libraries that were previously configured for a default sensitivity label:

1. The label selection for the document library remains but is deactivated so new files won't have the selected sensitivity label applied.
2. Sensitivity labels that were applied as a default label aren't removed. 


```yaml
Type: Boolean

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
