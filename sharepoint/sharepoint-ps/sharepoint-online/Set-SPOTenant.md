## DESCRIPTION

You can use the `Set-SPOTenant` cmdlet to enable external services and to specify the versions in which site collections can be created.
You can also use the `Set-SPOSite` cmdlet together with the `Set-SPOTenant` cmdlet to block access to a site in your organization and redirect traffic to another site.

You must be a SharePoint Online administrator or Global Administrator to run the cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

```powershell
Set-SPOSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team1 -LockState NoAccess
Set-SPOTenant -NoAccessRedirectUrl 'https://www.contoso.com'
```

This example blocks access to <https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team1> and redirects traffic to <https://www.contoso.com.>

### EXAMPLE 2

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ShowEveryoneExceptExternalUsersClaim $false
```

This example hides the "Everyone Except External Users" claim in People Picker.

### EXAMPLE 3

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ShowAllUsersClaim $false
```

This example hides the "All Users" claim group in People Picker.

### EXAMPLE 4

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -UsePersistentCookiesForExplorerView $true
```

This example enables the use of special persisted cookie for Open with Explorer.

### EXAMPLE 5

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -LegacyAuthProtocolsEnabled $True
```

This example enables legacy authentication protocols on the tenant. This can help to enable login in situations where the admin users get an error like "Cannot contact web site '<https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/'> or the web site does not support SharePoint Online credentials. The response status code is 'Unauthorized'.", and the underlying error is "Access denied. Before opening files in this location, you must first browse to the web site and select the option to login automatically."

### EXAMPLE 6

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ContentTypeSyncSiteTemplatesList MySites
```

This example enables Content Type Hub to push content types to all OneDrive for Business sites. There is no change in Content Type Publishing behavior for other sites.

### EXAMPLE 7

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ContentTypeSyncSiteTemplatesList MySites -ExcludeSiteTemplate
```

This example stops publishing content types to OneDrive for Business sites.

### EXAMPLE 8

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -SearchResolveExactEmailOrUPN $true
```

This example disables starts with for all users/partial name search functionality for all SharePoint users, except SharePoint Admins.

### EXAMPLE 9

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -UseFindPeopleInPeoplePicker $true
```

This example enables tenant admins to enable ODB and SPO to respect Exchange supports Address Book Policy (ABP) policies in the people picker.

### EXAMPLE 10

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -ShowPeoplePickerSuggestionsForGuestUsers $true
```

This example enables the option to search for existing guest users at Tenant Level.

### EXAMPLE 11

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim $true
```

This example sets Automatic Version Storage Limits on all new document libraries at Tenant Level.

### EXAMPLE 12

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim $false -MajorVersionLimit 500 -ExpireVersionsAfterDays 30
```

This example sets Manual Version Storage Limits on all new document libraries at Tenant Level by limiting the number of major versions and the time (in days) versions are kept. 

### EXAMPLE 13

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim $false -MajorVersionLimit 500 -ExpireVersionsAfterDays 0
```

This example sets Manual Version Storage Limits on all new document libraries at Tenant Level by limiting the number of major versions with no time limits.

### EXAMPLE 14

```powershell
PS > Set-SPOTenant -SharingDomainRestrictionMode "AllowList" -SharingAllowedDomainList "contoso.com fabrikam.com"
```

This example enables users to share with external collaborators from those domains only.

### EXAMPLE 15

```powershell
PS > Set-SPOTenant -SharingDomainRestrictionMode "BlockList" -SharingBlockedDomainList "contoso.com"
```

This example enables users to share with all external collaborators except for those on the BlockedDomainList.

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ShowEveryoneExceptExternalUsersClaim

Position: Named
Default value: True
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -SignInAccelerationDomain

Specifies the home realm discovery value to be sent to Microsoft Entra ID during the user sign-in process.

When the organization uses a third-party identity provider, this prevents the user from seeing the Microsoft Entra Home Realm Discovery web page and ensures the user only sees their company's Identity Provider's portal.
This value can also be used with Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 to customize the Microsoft Entra sign-in page.

Acceleration will not occur on site collections that are shared externally.

This value should be configured with the login domain that is used by your company (that is, example@contoso.com).

If your company has multiple third-party identity providers, configuring the sign-in acceleration value will break sign-in for your organization.

The valid values are:  

- "" (default) - Blank by default, this will also remove or clear any value that has been set.  
- Login Domain - For example: "contoso.com"

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StartASiteFormUrl

Specifies URL of the form to load in the Start a Site dialog.

The valid values are:  

- "" (default) - Blank by default, this will also remove or clear any value that has been set.  
- Full URL - Example: "<https://contoso.sharepoint.com/path/to/form">

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UsePersistentCookiesForExplorerView
> [!NOTE]
> This setting is not used anymore with Internet Explorer (IE) retired and the parameter would be removed soon. Users need to select "Yes" when prompted for "Stay signed in?" at the time of sign-in for "View in File Explorer" to work with Microsoft Edge. 

Lets SharePoint issue a special cookie that will allow this feature to work even when "Keep Me Signed In" is not selected.

"Open with Explorer" requires persisted cookies to operate correctly.
When the user does not select "Keep Me Signed in" at the time of sign-in, "Open with Explorer" will fail.

This special cookie expires after 30 minutes and cannot be cleared by closing the browser or signing out of SharePoint Online.
To clear this cookie, the user must log out of their Windows session.

The valid values are:  

- False (default) - No special cookie is generated and the normal Office 365 sign-in length/timing applies.  
- True - Generates a special cookie that will allow "Open with Explorer" to function if the "Keep Me Signed In" box is not checked at sign-in.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

To disable a specific web part, you need to enter its GUID as the parameter. You can enter multiple GUIDs by using a comma to separate them, for example Set-SPOTenant -DisabledWebPartIds 46698648-fcd5-41fc-9526-c7f7b2ace919,544dd15b-cf3c-441b-96da-004d5a8cea1d. To view a list of disabled web parts, use Get-SPOTenant to get DisabledWebPartIds.

To re-enable some disabled web parts, use the Set-SPOTenant with the -DisabledWebPartIds parameter and corresponding GUIDs that you still want to keep disabling. To re-enable all disabled web parts, use Set-SPOTenant -DisabledWebPartIds @().

### -DisableCustomAppAuthentication

Prevents apps using an Azure Access Control (ACS) app-only access token to access SharePoint. ACS, a service of Microsoft Entra ID, has been retired on November 7, 2018. This retirement does not impact the SharePoint add-in model, which uses the https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net hostname (which is not impacted by this retirement). For new tenants, apps using an ACS app-only access token are disabled by default. We recommend using the Microsoft Entra app-only model which is modern and more secure. Note that marking this property to $true doesn't prevent creating apps in SharePoint that use an Azure Access Control (ACS) app-only access token. Marking this property to $true only ensures that such apps can't access SharePoint anymore.

Accepts a value of true or false. By default this feature is set to true.

### -DisableOutlookPSTVersionTrimming

This parameter has no effect and it was used to opt-out of PST files retention policy changes as communicated in MC256835 (May 2021).
Starting August 16, 2021, the service started retaining 30 days worth of versions for any PST files stored in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online team site document libraries. This change was introduced to prevent cases of previous versions of PST files quickly consuming available storage. The change only impacts previous versions of PST files stored in your document library storage. As a best practice, PST files should not be uploaded on OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online team site document libraries due to the impact on storage and network bandwidth.

### -AllowAnonymousMeetingParticipantsToAccessWhiteboards
When you share a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link. This link is accessible by anyone within the organization. The whiteboard is also shared with any in-tenant users in the meeting. Whiteboards are shared using company-shareable links, regardless of the default setting. Support for the default sharing link type is planned.

There's more capability for temporary collaboration by external and shared device accounts during a Teams meeting. Users can temporarily view and collaborate on whiteboards that are shared in a meeting, in a similar way to PowerPoint Live sharing.

In this case, Whiteboard provides temporary viewing and collaboration on the whiteboard during the Teams meeting only. A share link isn't created and Whiteboard doesn't grant access to the file.

If you have external sharing enabled for OneDrive for Business, no further action is required.

If you restrict external sharing for OneDrive for Business, you can keep it restricted, and just enable this new setting in order for external and shared device accounts to work. For more information, see [Manage sharing for Microsoft Whiteboard](/microsoft-365/whiteboard/manage-sharing-organizations).

```yaml
Type: SharingState
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

### -IsEnableAppAuthPopUpEnabled

Enables or disables users in the organization to authenticate SharePoint applications using popups. 

This parameter affects the way code in SharePoint interacts with Microsoft Entra ID to get tokens to access APIs. In scenarios where third-party cookies are disabled (such as Safari browsers with ITP feature enabled), any code that requires a token to access an API automatically triggers a full page refresh. When IsEnableAppAuthPopUpEnabled is set to $true, SharePoint will instead surface a popup in this scenario.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BlockDownloadFileTypePolicy 

You can block the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive. This allows users to remain productive while addressing the risk of accidental data loss. Users have browser-only access to play the meeting recordings with no ability to download or sync files or access them through apps.

This policy applies to new meeting recordings across the entire organization. You can exempt people who are members of specified security groups from the policy. This allows you to specify governance or compliance specialists who should have download access to meeting recordings.

After the policy is turned on, any new Teams meeting recording files created by the Teams service and saved in SharePoint and OneDrive are blocked from download.

Because this policy affects meeting recordings stored in OneDrive and SharePoint, you must be a SharePoint administrator to configure it.

Note that this policy doesn't apply to manually uploaded meeting recording files. For more details, see [Block the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive](/microsoftteams/block-download-meeting-recording).

```yaml
Type: Boolean 
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: SharePoint Online
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim
Global and SharePoint admins in Microsoft 365 can set Organization-level Version History Limit settings that universally apply to new versions created on all new Document Libraries created in your organization. 

When Version History Limits are managed Automatically, SharePoint employs an algorithm behind the scenes that deletes (thins out) intermittent older versions that are least likely to be needed, while preserving sufficient high-value versions - more versions in the recent past and fewer farther back in time - in case restores are required.

The valid values are: 

- True – Version History Limits for new versions created on all new Document Libraries in your organization will be managed Automatically.  
- False – Version History Limits for new Versions created on all new Document Libraries in your organization will be managed Manually by setting limits to the number of major versions (MajorVersionLimit) and time set (ExpireVersionsAfterDays).  Review the documentation of both parameters to manage your organization's version limits Manually.  

> [!NOTE]
> When Version History Limits are managed Manually (EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim $false), MajorVersionLimit and ExpireVersionsAfterDays are both required parameters with the following acceptable values:
> a. MajorVersionLimit accepts values from 1 through 50,000 (inclusive).
> b. ExpireVersionsAfterDays accepts values of 0 to Never Expire or values >= 30 to delete versions that exceed that time period.
> When Version History Limits are managed Automatically (EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim $true), setting MajorVersionLimit or ExpireVersionsAfterDays will result in an error as the count limits are set by the service.
>
> This parameter is currently under private preview.

### -DelayDenyAddAndCustomizePagesEnforcement
This parameter controls how SharePoint will deal with sites where custom scripts are allowed.

The valid values are:

* False (default) - for site collections where administrators enabled the ability to add custom script, SharePoint will revoke that ability within 24 hours from the last time this setting was changed.
* True - All changes performed by administrators to custom script settings are preserved. When the value is set to true, a banner shows in the active sites list of the SharePoint admin center informing that changes to custom scripts are permanent.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting affects all sites. There are no options to preserve changes to custom script settings only on some specific sites. This parameter will be available until November 2024. After that time, administrators can still allow custom scripts on specific sites, but that change will be revoked automatically after up to 24 hours.
For more information, see [Allow or prevent custom script](/sharepoint/allow-or-prevent-custom-script).
