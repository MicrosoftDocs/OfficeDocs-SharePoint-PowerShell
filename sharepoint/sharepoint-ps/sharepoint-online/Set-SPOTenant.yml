parameters:
- type: <xref href="SharingState" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowAnonymousMeetingParticipantsToAccessWhiteboards
  description: |+
    When you share a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link. This link is accessible by anyone within the organization. The whiteboard is also shared with any in-tenant users in the meeting. Whiteboards are shared using company-shareable links, regardless of the default setting. Support for the default sharing link type is planned.

    There's more capability for temporary collaboration by external and shared device accounts during a Teams meeting. Users can temporarily view and collaborate on whiteboards that are shared in a meeting, in a similar way to PowerPoint Live sharing.

    In this case, Whiteboard provides temporary viewing and collaboration on the whiteboard during the Teams meeting only. A share link isn't created and Whiteboard doesn't grant access to the file.

    If you have external sharing enabled for OneDrive for Business, no further action is required.

    If you restrict external sharing for OneDrive for Business, you can keep it restricted, and just enable this new setting in order for external and shared device accounts to work. For more information, see [Manage sharing for Microsoft Whiteboard](/microsoft-365/whiteboard/manage-sharing-organizations).

  name: BlockDownloadFileTypePolicy
  description: |+
    You can block the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive. This allows users to remain productive while addressing the risk of accidental data loss. Users have browser-only access to play the meeting recordings with no ability to download or sync files or access them through apps.

    This policy applies to new meeting recordings across the entire organization. You can exempt people who are members of specified security groups from the policy. This allows you to specify governance or compliance specialists who should have download access to meeting recordings.

    After the policy is turned on, any new Teams meeting recording files created by the Teams service and saved in SharePoint and OneDrive are blocked from download.

    Because this policy affects meeting recordings stored in OneDrive and SharePoint, you must be a SharePoint administrator to configure it.

    Note that this policy doesn't apply to manually uploaded meeting recording files. For more details, see [Block the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive](/microsoftteams/block-download-meeting-recording).

    When a sensitivity label mismatch occurs between the label on the document uploaded and the label on the site, SharePoint Online captures an audit record, and sends an Incompatible sensitivity label detected email notification to the person who uploaded the document and the site owner. The notification contains details of the document which caused the problem and the label assigned to the document and to the site. The comparison happens between the priority of these two labels.

  description: |+
    Prevents apps using an Azure Access Control (ACS) app-only access token to access SharePoint. ACS, a service of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), has been retired on November 7, 2018. This retirement does not impact the SharePoint add-in model, which uses the https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net hostname (which is not impacted by this retirement). For new tenants, apps using an ACS app-only access token are disabled by default. We recommend using the Azure AD app-only model which is modern and more secure. Note that marking this property to $true doesn't prevent creating apps in SharePoint that use an Azure Access Control (ACS) app-only access token. Marking this property to $true only ensures that such apps can't access SharePoint anymore.

    Accepts a value of true or false. By default this feature is set to true.

    Allows administrators to prevent certain web parts from being added to pages or rendering on pages on which they were previously added. Currently, only the following web parts can be disabled in such a manner:

    - Amazon Kindle: 46698648-fcd5-41fc-9526-c7f7b2ace919

    - Stream: 275c0095-a77e-4f6d-a2a0-6a7626911518

    To disable a specific web part, you need to enter its GUID as the parameter. You can enter multiple GUIDs by using a comma to separate them, for example Set-SPOTenant -DisabledWebPartIds 46698648-fcd5-41fc-9526-c7f7b2ace919,544dd15b-cf3c-441b-96da-004d5a8cea1d. To view a list of disabled web parts, use Get-SPOTenant to get DisabledWebPartIds.

    To re-enable some disabled web parts, use the Set-SPOTenant with the -DisabledWebPartIds parameter and corresponding GUIDs that you still want to keep disabling. To re-enable all disabled web parts, use Set-SPOTenant -DisabledWebPartIds @().

    This parameter has no effect and it was used to opt-out of PST files retention policy changes as communicated in MC256835 (May 2021).
    Starting August 16, 2021, the service started retaining 30 days worth of versions for any PST files stored in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online team site document libraries. This change was introduced to prevent cases of previous versions of PST files quickly consuming available storage. The change only impacts previous versions of PST files stored in your document library storage. As a best practice, PST files should not be uploaded on OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online team site document libraries due to the impact on storage and network bandwidth.

  description: |+
    Global and SharePoint admins in Microsoft 365 can set Organization-level Version History Limit settings that universally apply to new versions created on all new Document Libraries created in your organization. 

    When Version History Limits are managed Automatically, SharePoint employs an algorithm behind the scenes that deletes (thins out) intermittent older versions that are least likely to be needed, while preserving sufficient high-value versions - more versions in the recent past and fewer farther back in time - in case restores are required.

    The valid values are: 

    - True - Version History Limits for new versions created on all new Document Libraries in your organization will be managed Automatically.  
    - False - Version History Limits for new Versions created on all new Document Libraries in your organization will be managed Manually by setting limits to the number of major versions (MajorVersionLimit) and time set (ExpireVersionsAfterDays).  Review the documentation of both parameters to manage your organization's version limits Manually.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > When Version History Limits are managed Manually (EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim $false), MajorVersionLimit and ExpireVersionsAfterDays are both required parameters with the following acceptable values:
    > a. MajorVersionLimit accepts values from 1 through 50,000 (inclusive).
    > b. ExpireVersionsAfterDays accepts values of 0 to Never Expire or values >= 30 to delete versions that exceed that time period.
    > When Version History Limits are managed Automatically (EnableAutoExpirationVersionTrim $true), setting MajorVersionLimit or ExpireVersionsAfterDays will result in an error as the count limits are set by the service.
    >
