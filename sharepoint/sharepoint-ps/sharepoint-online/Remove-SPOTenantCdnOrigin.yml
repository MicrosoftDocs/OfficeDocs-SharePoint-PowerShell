  description: |+
    Specifies a path to the doc library to be configured. It can be provided in two ways: relative path, or a mask.

    Relative-Relative path depends on the OriginScope. If the originScope is Tenant, a path must be a relative path under the tenant root. If the originScope is Site, a path must be a relative path under the given Site. The path must point to the valid Document Library or a folder with a document library.

    Any asset stored under the path provided (in the container itself or any of its subfolders) will be exposed via CDN

    Mask - Mask allows to configure a partial URL match. It must start with */, and must not include * anywhere else. I.e. an origin "*/masterpages" will expose all the assets under all the masterpages libraries, either under the tenant root (means, anywhere in the tenancy) or in the given site collection, depends on the OriginScope parameter. Equally, */masterpages/subfolder will enable items in "subfolder" and below.
