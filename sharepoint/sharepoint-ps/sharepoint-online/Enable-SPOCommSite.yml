    **Error case 2: Feature is not yet enabled for your tenant**

    The use of this cmdlet is subject to the feature rollout. If the feature is not yet available for your tenant, the cmdlet will not execute and will show this error:

    We do not support sites that currently have or have had in the past enabled the classic publishing features. If you see this error, your site is not eligible for this feature enablement.
