description: |-
  The `Request-SPOUpgradeEvaluationSite` cmdlet lets the SharePoint Online administrator request a copy of an existing site collection for the purposes of validating the effects of upgrade without affecting the original site.

  A request for an upgrade evaluation site is not automatically processed.
  Instead, it is scheduled to occur in the background when it causes the least effect on the service.

  You must be at least a SharePoint administrator to run the cmdlet.
