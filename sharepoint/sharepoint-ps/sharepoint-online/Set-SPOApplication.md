## SYNTAX

```

 [-OverrideTenantSharingCapability] <Boolean> [-CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts] <String> [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ParamSet1

```powershell
Set-SPOApplication 
[[-OwningApplicationId] <Guid>] 
[[â€“SharingCapability] <SharingCapability>] 
[[-OverrideTenantSharingCapability] <Boolean>]
[[-CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts] <String>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

`Set-SPOApplication` cmdlet is used to set the configuration properties of a specific application, determined by the `OwningApplicationId`.

You must be a SharePoint Embedded Administrator to run the cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]   
> The OwningApplicationId for Microsoft Loop is `a187e399-0c36-4b98-8f04-1edc167a0996`.
> The OwningApplicationId for Microsoft Designer is `5e2795e3-ce8c-4cfb-b302-35fe5cd01597`.

To invite people outside your organization, please make sure [Microsoft Entra B2B](/sharepoint/sharepoint-azureb2b-integration) is enabled. 

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
Set-SPOApplication -OwningApplicationId 423poi45-jikl-9bnm-b302-1234ghy56789 -OverrideTenantSharingCapability $false
```

This example disables the override sharing capability, aligning this SharePoint Embedded application's sharing settings with sharing capability of the SharePoint Online.

### Example 2

```powershell
Set-SPOApplication -OwningApplicationId 423poi45-jikl-9bnm-b302-1234ghy56789 -OverrideTenantSharingCapability $true -SharingCapability -Disabled
```

This example enables the override, restricting file sharing within the SharePoint Embedded application to internal company users only, regardless of the broader SharePoint Online tenant settings.

### Example 3

```powershell
Set-SPOTenant -EnableAzureADB2BIntegration $true
Set-SPOApplication -OwningApplicationId 423poi45-jikl-9bnm-b302-1234ghy56789 -OverrideTenantSharingCapability $true -SharingCapability -ExternalUserandGuestSharing
```
This example demonstrates how to enable file sharing within the SharePoint Embedded application for external users. Note that B2B integration must be enabled to allow guest invitations to SharePoint Embedded apps.

### Example 4

```powershell
Set-SPOApplication -OwningApplicationId 423poi45 -CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts "http://localhost:3000 https://prepspo.spgrid.com https://pemdevtenant.myownsite.com" 
```
This example sets the host URLs for the application with Id 423poi45.
