    > [!NOTE]
    > Prior to the December 2017 release of the SPO Management Shell, the **Add-SPOTheme** cmdlet required that color palette settings be passed as a dictionary. We recommend that you use the latest version of the SPO Management Shell, or use the `HashToDictionary` function to convert a hash table to a dictionary if needed.
  summary: |+
    In this example, a new theme named `"Custom Cyan"` is created, with color palette settings that are various shades of cyan. Note that the settings are passed as a hash table.

- title: Example 2
  code: |-
    Add-SPOTheme -Identity "Custom Cyan" -Palette $themepalette -IsInverted $false -Overwrite
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    If you want to update an existing theme (to modify some of its color settings, for example), use the same syntax as shown previously, but add the `-Overwrite` flag to the **Add-SPOTheme** cmdlet.

  The **Add-SPOTheme** cmdlet creates a new theme or updates an existing theme. The color palette settings can be passed as either a hash table or a dictionary.

  Adding a theme does not apply the theme to any sites. It adds the theme to your tenant store, and then the theme is available in the list of themes under the **Change the look** option for modern pages.
