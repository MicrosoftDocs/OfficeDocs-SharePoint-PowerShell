description: |-
  The `Connect-SPOService` cmdlet connects a SharePoint Online administrator or Global Administrator to the SharePoint Online Administration Center.

  Only a single SharePoint Online service connection is maintained from any single Windows PowerShell session.
  In other words, this is a per-organization administrator connection.
  Running the `Connect-SPOService` cmdlet twice implicitly disconnects the previous connection.
  The Windows PowerShell session will be set to serve the new SharePoint Online administrator specified.

  A delegated partner administrator has to swap connections for different organizations within the same Windows PowerShell session.

  You must be a SharePoint Online administrator or Global Administrator to run the cmdlet.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Online, see the online documentation at [Intro to SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell?view=sharepoint-ps).
