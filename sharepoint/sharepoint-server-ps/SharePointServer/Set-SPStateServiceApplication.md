## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE
```powershell
Set-SPStateServiceApplication -Identity "State Service Application 1" -Name "New name for State Service Application 1"
```

This example changes the display name of a state service application.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

Specifies the state service application to update.

The type must be a valid name of a state service application (for example, StateServiceApp1); a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; or an instance of a valid SPStateServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SPStateServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection

> Applicable: SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command.

### -Name

> Applicable: SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
