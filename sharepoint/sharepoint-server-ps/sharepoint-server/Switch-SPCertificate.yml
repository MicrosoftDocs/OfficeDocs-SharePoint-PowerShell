parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  You may wish to replace all usage of a certificate within SharePoint with a different certificate.
  For example, if an existing certificate is approaching its expiration and you've imported a new certificate to replace it.
  Use the Switch-SPCertificate cmdlet to replace the assignments of one certificate with a different certificate.
  All usage of that certificate within SharePoint will then be replaced with the different certificate.
