  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  Use the `New-SPSiteSubscriptionFeaturePack` cmdlet to create a new SharePoint Feature set that limits the Features available to a specified site subscription.

  SharePoint Feature sets are on an Allow List of SharePoint Features that can be associated with any site subscription.
  If a Feature set is assigned to a site subscription, only SPFeatures objects in that Feature set are available for use on the site collections and Webs that are members of the site subscription.
  Feature sets contain a list of the GUIDs of each Feature that is on an Allow List for associated site subscriptions.
