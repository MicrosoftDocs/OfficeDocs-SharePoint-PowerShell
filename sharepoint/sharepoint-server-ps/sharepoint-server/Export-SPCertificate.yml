parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm

    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EncryptionType
  description: |+
    Specifies the encryption algorithm to use to protect the exported PFX file.
    AES256 specifies that AES-256 encryption with SHA256 hashing will be used.
    TripleDes specifies that 3DES encryption with SHA1 hashing will be used.
    AES-256 encryption is stronger than 3DES encryption, but is only supported with PFX files on Windows Server 2019 and newer operating systems.
    Use 3DES encryption if the PFX file needs to be compatible with older operating systems.
    If this parameter isn't specified, AES-256 encryption is used by default.
    This parameter is only compatible with PFX files.

  name: IncludeAllCertificatesInCertificationPath
  description: |+
    Specifies whether to export additional certificates that are part of the certificate chain of the specified certificate.
    This will only add parent certificates of the specified certificate, not child certificates issued by the specified certificate.
    This parameter is only compatible with PFX and P7B files.

- type: <xref href="SecureString" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Password
  isRequired: true

- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Path
  description: |+

    Specifies the type of file to generate.
    Cert will generate a CER file containing a single DER-encoded certificate.
    Pkcs7 will generate a P7B (PKCS #7) file containing one or more certificates.
    This parameter is only compatible with CER and P7B files.

  defaultValue: None

uid: sharepoint-server.Export-SPCertificate
name: Export-SPCertificate
description: |-
  Exports certificates from the SharePoint farm into a certificate file.
  This exported certificate file is stored in the Central Administration site by default, but can also be stored in a path specified by the Path parameter.

  SharePoint supports exporting certificates to PFX (PKCS #12) files, P7B (PKCS #7) files, and CER files.
  Both PFX files and P7B files can contain multiple certificates, which is useful for exporting a chain of certificates from the end entity (leaf) certificate to the root certificate. 
  However, only PFX files can contain private keys for certificates, which are necessary for a server certificate to be assigned to an IIS web site.
  CER files contain only a single certificate.
