  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  The `Update-SPSecureStoreApplicationServerKey` cmdlet synchronizes the key on a SharePoint server with the master key for the Secure Store service database.

  Updating a server key is required when:

  --A new SharePoint server that will run a Secure Store service instance is joined to the farm.
  --The key stored in the server is not the key required for the current Secure Store service database (because of server or networking issues).
  --The master key is updated but during propagation of the new key, this process fails on one or more of the servers.
