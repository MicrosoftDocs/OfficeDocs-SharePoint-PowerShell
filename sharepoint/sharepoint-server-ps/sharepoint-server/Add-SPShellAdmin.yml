parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  When you run this cmdlet to add a user to the SharePoint_Shell_Access role, you must have membership in the securityadmin fixed server role on the SQL Server instance, membership in the db_owner fixed database role on all affected databases, and local administrative permission on the local computer.

  This cmdlet is intended only to be used with a database that uses Windows authentication.
  There is no need to use this cmdlet for databases that use SQL authentication; in fact, doing so may result in an error message.

  Use the Add-SPShellAdmin cmdlet to add a user to the SharePoint_Shell_Access role as follows:

  --If you specify only the user, the user is added to the role for the farm configuration database.

  --If you use the database parameter, the user is added to the role on the farm configuration database, the Central Administration content database, and the specified database. Using the database parameter is the preferred method because most of the administrative operations require access to the Central Administration content database.

  The user is added to the WSS_Admin_WPG group on all Web servers when the user is added to the SharePoint_Shell_Access role.
  If the target database does not have a SharePoint_Shell_Access role, the role is automatically created.

  In order to use Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, a user must be a member of the SharePoint_Shell_Access role on the configuration database and a member of the WSS_ADMIN_WPG local group on the computer where SharePoint Products is installed.

  However, the result of running this cmdlet is that the user specified with the UserName parameter will have the **SPDataAccess** role, if it exists, or db_owner role, if the SPDataAccess role does not exist, on the affected databases as described above. Therefore, you should carefully plan which users are given this access.

  Therefore, you should carefully plan which users are given this access.
