  description: |-
    This example stops publishing of the specified service application outside the farm.

    The service application GUID is unique to every farm.
    You can run the `Get-SPServiceApplication` cmdlet to see the GUID of the service applications and then use the result from the `Get-SPServiceApplication` cmdlet for other SPServiceApplication cmdlets; for example, `Publish-SPServiceApplication`.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
