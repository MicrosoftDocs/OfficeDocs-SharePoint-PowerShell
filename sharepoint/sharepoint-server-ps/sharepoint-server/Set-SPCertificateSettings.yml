    This examples changes the certificate expiration warning threshold to 22 days.
    SharePoint will begin sending warnings about upcoming certificate expirations 22 days before they expire.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateExpirationAttentionThreshold
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of days before a certificate expires to trigger a certificate expiration notification.
    This is a reminder of upcoming certificate expirations that can be handled with normal priority.
    A certificate will only trigger a notification when it is assigned to SharePoint objects.
    This notification is disabled when set to 0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateExpirationErrorThreshold
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of days after a certificate expired to trigger a certificate expiration alert.
    This is an alert about certificates that have already expired and should be handled with critical priority.
    A certificate will only trigger an alert when it is assigned to SharePoint objects.
    This alert is disabled when set to 0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateExpirationWarningThreshold
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of days before a certificate expires to trigger a certificate expiration warning.
    This is a warning of imminent certificate expirations that should be handled with high priority.
    A certificate will only trigger a warning when it is assigned to SharePoint objects.
    This warning is disabled when set to 0.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Country
  description: |+
    The 2 letter country code where your organization is legally located.
    This must be an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="EllipticCurveType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EllipticCurve
  description: |+
    Specifies the elliptic curve of your public and private ECC keys.

    Larger elliptic curves provide more cryptographic strength than smaller elliptic curves, but they're also more computationally expensive and take more time to complete the SSL/TLS connection.
    Select nistP256 if you're unsure which elliptic curve to use.
    Elliptic curves larger than nistP384 are not recommended.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Default, nistP256, nistP384, nistP521
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HashAlgorithm
  description: |+
    Specifies the hash algorithm of your certificate signature, which your certificate authority will use to verify that your certificate request hasn't been tampered with.

    Larger hash algorithms provide more cryptographic strength than smaller hash algorithms, but they're also more computationally expensive.
    Select SHA256 if you're unsure which hash algorithm to use.
    Hash algorithms larger than SHA384 are not recommended.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Default, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512
- type: <xref href="KeyAlgorithmGroup" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: KeyAlgorithm
  description: |+
    Specifies the key algorithm for your certificate.
    This choice will be used for both the public key and the private key of your certificate.

    RSA is the most common and widely supported key algorithm for certificates.
    Select the RSA algorithm if you're unsure which type of key your certificate authority supports.

    ECC uses elliptic curve cryptography based on ECDSA keys with NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves.
    SSL/TLS connections are faster to complete with ECC certificates than RSA certificates at the equivalent security strength.
    Verify that your certificate authority supports ECC certificates before selecting it.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ECC, RSA
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: KeySize
  description: |+
    Specifies the size of your public and private RSA keys in bits.

    Larger key sizes provide more cryptographic strength than smaller key sizes, but they're also more computationally expensive and take more time to complete the SSL/TLS connection.
    Select 2048 if you're unsure which key size to use.
    Key sizes larger than 4096 are not recommended.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="RsaSignaturePaddingType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RsaSignaturePadding
  description: |+
    Specifies the RSA signature padding mode for creating and renewing certificates with RSA keys.
    Pkcs1 represents the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 padding mode.
    Pss represents the RSASSA-PSS padding mode.
    The default RSA signature padding mode is Pkcs1.

  defaultValue: None
