parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `New-SPUser` cmdlet adds an existing user to a SharePoint web site with the designated permissions.
  This user has the given permissions in all subsites that inherit permissions.
  The user account must already exist in the user directory.

  If your environment is in Active Directory mode, the user must already exist in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and only the UserAlias parameter is required; all other fields are pulled from AD DS.
  If only an alias is given and the farm is in Active Directory Account Create mode, the Email parameter is also required.
