  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The Get-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlMapping cmdlet reads a CrawlMapping object when one of the crawl mapping rules is created, updated, or deleted.
  Run this cmdlet when the search is initially configured, and when access is changed through a different mechanism to create the crawl mapping rule; for example, when a rule is changed to use file:\\\\ rather than http://.

  If the Identity parameter is not specified, this cmdlet returns the crawl mapping collection for the specified search application.
