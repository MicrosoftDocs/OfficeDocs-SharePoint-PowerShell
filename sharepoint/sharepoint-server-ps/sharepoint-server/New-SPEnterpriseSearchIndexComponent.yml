parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  name: RootDirectory
  description: |+
    Specifies the root directory that will hold the index location for the new search index component.
    This is needed if you want to isolate the index on dedicated discs in order to avoid I/O contention with other parts of the system, other system sharing the same disks, or because you do not want to risk the index filling up the OS disk (generally C: )

    If you specify the root directory to be the root of a volume, e.g.
    E:, the index will not be cleaned up if you delete the SSA. 
    You will then have to delete the SSA manually.
