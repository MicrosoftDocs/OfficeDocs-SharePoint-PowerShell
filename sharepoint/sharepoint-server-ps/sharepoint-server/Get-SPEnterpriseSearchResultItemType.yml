  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The Get-SPEnterpriseSearchResultItemType cmdlet retrieves the result item types that exist for the specified owner.

  Result item types enable you to change the look of search results based on the type of result.
  You start by defining a collection of rules, which will be evaluated against the properties of results.
  Then you define the display template to use for rendering that type of result. 
  Once you have created the result item type, results matching the rules of the result item type will render using the specified display template.

  Example use cases:

  - Change the look of results for a particular file name extension, for example Word documents.
  - Change the look of a particular content type in search results.
  - Change the look of results from a particular author.
  - Add a result action to results from a particular result source as part of a custom search application.
