  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  The New-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlExtension cmdlet adds a file name extension to the list of file types that you want to include in the index.
  After a new IFilter is registered, run this cmdlet so that the new file type will be crawled.
  If a file type is added without registering an associated IFilter, only the file properties will be crawled and included in the index.
  After you run this cmdlet, you must run a full crawl of all content sources that might contain this file type to guarantee that files of this type are in the index.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).
