  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  The Get-SPWebPartPack cmdlet returns the installed Web Part packages that match the Identity parameter.
  The scope of results can be narrowed by using the optional WebApplication parameter.
  The scope does not include any Web Part packages installed in the global assembly cache (GAC) unless the GlobalOnly parameter is used.
  If this parameter is used, only Web Part packages that have been installed in the GAC are returned.
