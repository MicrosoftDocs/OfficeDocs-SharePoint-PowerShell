parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
  You may only use parameters from one parameter set, and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
  For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet parameter sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-parameter-sets).

  The Get-SPSiteSubscriptionFeaturePack cmdlet retrieves available SharePoint Feature sets or the Feature set assigned to a given site subscription.

  Be careful when you assign Feature sets to variables because changes to the Feature set are not reflected until the variable is refreshed.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).
