  description: |-
    This example creates a new ContentEnrichmentConfiguration object.
    The URL of the external web service is stored in the $config.Endpoint property.
    The new ContentEnrichmentConfiguration is configured to use Title and URL, which are the managed properties that you want to send to the external web service. 
    It is also configured to expect the external web service to output the same managed properties. 
    The SearchServiceApplication object is retrieved and used for storing the newly created ContentEnrichmentConfiguration.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
