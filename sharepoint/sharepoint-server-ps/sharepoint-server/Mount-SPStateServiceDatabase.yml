  code: |-
    Mount-SPStateServiceDatabase -Name "statedata1" -DatabaseServer "localhost"
  description: |-
    This example associates a SharePoint Server farm with a SQL Server database.

    This example is used in least privilege scenarios when an administrator cannot create databases in SQL.
    The database must already exist and be empty.
    The database cannot be used until the Initialize-SPStateServiceDatabase cmdlet is run, so errors could occur with this example.

  code: |-
    Mount-SPStateServiceDatabase -Name "statedata1" -DatabaseServer "localhost" -ServiceApplication "ServiceApp1" -Weight 10 | Initialize-SPStateServiceDatabase
  description: |-
    This example associates a SharePoint Server farm with a SQL Server database, at the same time that it also associates the database with a service application and gives a weight of 10.
    The result is immediately piped to the Initialize-SPStateServiceDatabase cmdlet so that the database can be used.
  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
