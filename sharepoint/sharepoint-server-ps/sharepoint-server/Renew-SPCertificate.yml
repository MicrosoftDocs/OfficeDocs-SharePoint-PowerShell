  name: AlternativeNames
  description: |+
    Additional DNS domain names or IP addresses that this certificate will be assigned to.
    Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) are recommended.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  name: Country
  description: |+
    The 2 letter country code where your organization is legally located.
    This must be an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
    If this parameter is not specified, the default country of the farm will be used.

- type: <xref href="EllipticCurveType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: EllipticCurve
  description: |+
    Specifies to use the elliptic curve cryptography key algorithm for your certificate, and the elliptic curve of your public and private ECC keys.

    Larger elliptic curves provide more cryptographic strength than smaller elliptic curves, but they're also more computationally expensive and take more time to complete the SSL/TLS connection.
    Select nistP256 if you're unsure which elliptic curve to use.
    Elliptic curves larger than nistP384 are not recommended.

    If neither this parameter nor the KeySize parameter is specified, the default key algorithm and key size / elliptic curve of the farm will be used.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Exportable
  description: |+
    Specifies whether the private key of the certificate may be exported.
    If this parameter isn't specified, the private key of certificate deployed to the Windows Certificate Store on each server in the SharePoint farm will not be exportable, and SharePoint will not allow you to export the private key from within the SharePoint administration interface.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FriendlyName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    The friendly name for the certificate.
    This name can be used to help you remember the purpose of this certificate.
    The friendly name will only be visible to SharePoint farm administrators, not to end users.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HashAlgorithm
  description: |+
    Specifies the hash algorithm of your certificate signature, which your certificate authority will use to verify that your certificate request hasn't been tampered with.

    Larger hash algorithms provide more cryptographic strength than smaller hash algorithms, but they're also more computationally expensive.
    Select SHA256 if you're unsure which hash algorithm to use.
    Hash algorithms larger than SHA384 are not recommended.

    If this parameter is not specified, the default hash algorithm of the farm will be used.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: KeySize
  description: |+
    Specifies to use the RSA key algorithm for your certificate, and the size of your public and private RSA keys in bits.

    Larger key sizes provide more cryptographic strength than smaller key sizes, but they're also more computationally expensive and take more time to complete the SSL/TLS connection.
    Select 2048 if you're unsure which key size to use.
    Key sizes larger than 4096 are not recommended.

    If neither this parameter nor the EllipticCurve parameter is specified, the default key algorithm and key size / elliptic curve of the farm will be used.

- SharePoint Server Subscription Edition
uid: sharepoint-server.Renew-SPCertificate
name: Renew-SPCertificate
description: |-
  SharePoint supports renewing SSL certificates via the Renew-SPCertificate PowerShell cmdlet.
  This creates a new certificate signing request based on the properties of an existing certificate and is the first step in a three-step process to renew an SSL certificate.

  Once an SSL certificate request is created via the operation, the SharePoint administrator must submit the certificate request to their SSL certificate authority.
  The SSL certificate authority will then generate a signed certificate based on the request and return it to the SharePoint administrator.
  The SharePoint administrator must then import the certificate provided by the SSL certificate authority into SharePoint.
  SharePoint will then pair the imported certificate with the private key generated by the certificate request operation.
  The certificate is then ready to be used by SharePoint.

  When you import a certificate as part of a certificate renewal operation, you can specify the Replace switch parameter with the Import-SPCertificate cmdlet.
  This tells SharePoint to automatically replace the certificate assignments of the certificate being renewed with the new certificate.
