  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: "Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.\r\nUse of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.\r\nUsing the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.\r\nWhen SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.\r\n        \r\nWhen the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.\r\nIf objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  name: MakeDefault
  description: |+
    Specifies whether the result source should be set as default result source or not, for the scope specified by the Owner parameter.

    If parameter is not specified, the default result source will not change.

    Setting value to true ($true) states that the result source should be set as default.

    Setting value to false ($false) states that the result source should not be set as default and in this case, if the result source to update is currently the default, the original default result source ("Local SharePoint Results") will be set as default again. 

    Tip: Use instance, not name or GUID string Id, as Identity when using Makedefault, to clearly specify that Owner is only to be used for specifying the level where the result source should be set as default (if value is true) or where the default should be reset to original (if value is false).
