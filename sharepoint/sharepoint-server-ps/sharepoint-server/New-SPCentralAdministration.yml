parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  name: Port
  description: |+
    Specifies the port number for Central Administration.
    If no port is specified, a nonconflicting port number is auto-generated.

    The type must be a valid port number.

    If you specify a port number that has already been assigned, IIS does not start the new site until you change either the port number of the new site or the port number of the old site.

  name: SecureSocketsLayer
  description: |+
    Enables Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for the specified port. If you choose to use SSL, you must assign a server certificate to the Central Administration IIS web site by using the IIS administration tools. The Central Administration web application won't be accessible until you do this.

    The default value is False.

    If this parameter is omitted or set to False the Central Administration site will use HTTP for the specified port.
