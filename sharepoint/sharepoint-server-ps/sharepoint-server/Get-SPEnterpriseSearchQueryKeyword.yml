parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The Get-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryKeyword cmdlet reads a QueryKeyword object when the keyword rule is created, updated, or deleted.

  If the Identity parameter is not specified, this cmdlet returns the query keyword collection from the specified search application.

  You can use this cmdlet for keywords in site collections that are in SharePoint Server mode.
  You cannot use this cmdlet after a site collection is upgraded to SharePoint Server mode because keywords and Best Bets are automatically migrated to query rules.
