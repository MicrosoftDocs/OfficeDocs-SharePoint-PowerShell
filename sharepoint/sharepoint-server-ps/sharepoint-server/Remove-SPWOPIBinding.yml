parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Action
  description: |+
    Specifies the action to remove bindings for.
    For example, "view," "edit," and "embedview." For a list of actions run `Get-SPWOPIBinding`.
    Most typically you will not use this parameter.
    If you specify some actions but not others, some features in SharePoint may not work.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - SharePoint Server Subscription Edition
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  name: Application
  description: |+

- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `Remove-SPWOPIBinding` cmdlet removes bindings for applications, file name extensions and their associated actions on the current SharePoint farm where this cmdlet is run. 
  After you run this cmdlet, you can use `New-SPWOPIBinding` to re-create the bindings as needed.
  If you remove all the bindings for an application, users cannot use Office Web Apps or the SharePoint Share by link feature for that application.
  If you remove all the bindings on the SharePoint farm where this cmdlet is run, users cannot use Office Web Apps or the SharePoint Share by link feature for any applications in the SharePoint library.

  If you want to stop using Office Web Apps for default clicks, but must preserve the bindings' discovery information and the ability for users to use the SharePoint Share by link feature to send a link to a document and allow the recipient to use Office Web Apps for that document type, use the `New-SPWOPISuppression` cmdlet instead.
