  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: "Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.\r\nUse of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.\r\nUsing the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.\r\nWhen SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.\r\n        \r\nWhen the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.\r\nIf objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  This cmdlet creates a result source.
  Use result sources to scope search results and federate queries to external sources, such as internet search engines.
  After defining a result source, configure search web parts and query rule actions to use it.
  Result Sources replace Search Scopes, which are now deprecated.
  This cmdlet supports the same create operations as are supported through the "Manage Result Sources" page in Central Administration, except the operations "Form Authentication" and "Cookie Authentication".
