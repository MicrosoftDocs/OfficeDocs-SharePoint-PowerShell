parameters:

  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  After upgrading from Office SharePoint Server to SharePoint Server, run the `Update-SPProfilePhotoStore` cmdlet to ensure that the SharePoint profile photo store is compatible with SharePoint Server.
  The `Update-SPProfilePhotoStore` cmdlet should be used only after an upgrade from Office SharePoint Server has completed.
  When the `Update-SPProfilePhotoStore` cmdlet is used, three thumbnail versions with predictable sizes and names are created from the original photo, the new photos are placed into the My Site Host's User Photos library, and the property value in the profile database is updated.

  During the operation, the original image is left as-is.
  If the operation fails for certain users for any reason, it continues on to the next user.

  During the migration of profile photos from one server URL to another, one can use the OldBaseUri and NewBaseUri parameters.
  You just need to specify the starting portion of the URL that has changed from old to new and an attempt to rebase the profile picture URLs will occur.

  For example, OldBaseUri: https://server1/my/ProfilePhotos; NewBaseUri: https://server1/my/NewLocation/ProfilePhotos
