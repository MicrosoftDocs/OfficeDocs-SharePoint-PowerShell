parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

uid: sharepoint-server.Enable-SPFeature
name: Enable-SPFeature
description: |-
  The Enable-SPFeature cmdlet enables an installed feature at the given scope. 
  If the feature is a farm feature, no URL is needed.
  Otherwise, provide the URL where the feature is to be enabled and it will be enabled at the proper scope based on the Feature definition.

  This cmdlet has no output unless the PassThru parameter is provided, in which case the SPFeatureDefinition object for the newly enabled feature is returned.

  If you try to use the Url parameter on a farm-scoped feature, you receive the following error message:

  The feature '\<feature name\>' applies to the entire farm; the Url parameter cannot be used with farm-scoped features.
