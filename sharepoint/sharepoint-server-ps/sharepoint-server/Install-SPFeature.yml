parameters:

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
  You may only use parameters from one parameter set, and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
  For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet parameter sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-parameter-sets).

  The Install-SPFeature cmdlet installs a specific SPFeature by providing, in the Identity parameter, the relative path from the version-specific common FEATURES folder to the feature.
  The version-specific FEATURES folder is "$env:ProgramFiles\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\TEMPLATE\FEATURES\" if the site collection is in 14 mode, and "$env:ProgramFiles\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\15\TEMPLATE\FEATURES\" if the site collection is in 15 mode.
  The SharePoint Feature's files must already be put in the proper directory, either manually or by using a solution installer.

  If the value of the AllExistingFeatures parameter is true, the file system is scanned and all new features that are in both FEATURES folders are installed.
  This is generally only used during deployment and upgrade.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).
