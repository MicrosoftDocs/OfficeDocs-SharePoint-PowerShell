parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
  You may only use parameters from one parameter set, and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
  For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet parameter sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-parameter-sets).

  Use the `Test-SPContentDatabase` cmdlet to test a content database against a Web application to verify all customizations referenced within the content database are also installed in the web application.
  This cmdlet can be issued against a content database currently attached to the farm, or a content database that is not connected to the farm.
  It can be used to test content databases from SharePoint 2010 Products and from SharePoint Products and Technologies.

  The `Test-SPContentDatabase` cmdlet does not change any of the data or structure of the content database, but can cause load on the database while the checks are in progress, which could temporarily block use of the content database.
  This cmdlet should only be used against a content database that is currently under low or no usage.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at [SharePoint Server Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-server/sharepoint-server-cmdlets).
