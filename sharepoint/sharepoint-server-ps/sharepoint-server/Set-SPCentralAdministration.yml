  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowLegacyEncryption
  description: |+
    Specifies that older SSL and TLS protocol versions and cipher suites are allowed to be used with this IIS website.
    Legacy encryption is weaker than modern encryption and is not recommended.

    This feature requires Windows Server 2022 or higher.
    This feature is not available when SharePoint is deployed with earlier versions of Windows Server.

    This parameter is only valid when used with the SecureSocketsLayer parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - SharePoint Server Subscription Edition
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  defaultValue: None

    This parameter is only valid when used with the SecureSocketsLayer parameter.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HostHeader
  description: |+
    The host header of the Central Administration IIS website.

    If this parameter is omitted, there will be no host header binding and the URL of the Central Administration site will be based on the name of this server.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Port
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the administration port for the Central Administration site.

    The type must be a valid port number; for example, 8080.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - SharePoint Server Subscription Edition
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SecureSocketsLayer
  description: |+
    Enables Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for the Central Administration IIS website.
    If you choose to use SSL, you must import a server certificate to SharePoint and assign it to the Central Administration IIS website for this web application.
    The Central Administration web application won't be accessible until you do this.

    The default value is False.

    If this parameter is omitted or set to False, the Central Administration site will use HTTP for the specified port.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - SharePoint Server Subscription Edition
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Url
  description: |+
    Specifies the load-balanced URL for Central Administration.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""

  - SharePoint Server Subscription Edition
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseServerNameIndication
  description: |+
    Specifies that the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) binding of this IIS website should use Server Name Indication (SNI).
    Server Name Indication allows multiple IIS websites with unique host headers and unique server certificates to share the same SSL port.
    If Server Name Indication isn't used, all IIS websites sharing the same SSL port must share the same server certificate.

  defaultValue: None
