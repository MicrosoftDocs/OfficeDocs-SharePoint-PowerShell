parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  WSS User sync synchronizes Project Server permissions with SharePoint Server permissions.
  When users are granted permissions to Project Server entities, permissions are granted to the Project Web App site and the connected SharePoint sites.
  By using this cmdlet, administrators can control the behavior of WSS User sync.
  They can choose to disable WSS User sync, enable it only for the Project Web App site, enable it only for connected SharePoint sites, or enable for both.

  For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for Project Server, see the online documentation at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251833 (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251833).
