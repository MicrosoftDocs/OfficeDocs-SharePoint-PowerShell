  description: |-
    This example translates incoming requests for https://www.contoso.com into https://sharepoint.contoso.com (on the Internet zone).

    When a reverse proxy is being set up to handle public URL SSL termination, alternate access mappings must be configured to handle the URL translation.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  This cmdlet contains more than one parameter set.
  You may only use parameters from one parameter set, and you may not combine parameters from different parameter sets.
  For more information about how to use parameter sets, see [Cmdlet parameter sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-parameter-sets).

  The New-SPAlternateUrl cmdlet creates a new public or internal URL for the specified Web application zone or resource.
  Use the ResourceName parameter if the alternate URL is for an external resource.

  Each Web application can be associated with a collection of mappings between internal and public URLs.
  Both internal and public URLs consist of the protocol and domain portion of the full URL; for example, https://www.fabrikam.com.
  Users type a public URL to get to the SharePoint site, and that URL appears in the links on the pages.
  Internal URLs are in the URL requests that are sent to the SharePoint site.
  Many internal URLs can be associated with a single public URL in multiserver farms; for example, when a load balancer routes requests to specific IP addresses to various servers in the load-balancing cluster.

  Each Web application supports five collections of mappings per URL; the five collections correspond to five zones (default, intranet, extranet, Internet, and custom).
  When the Web application receives a request for an internal URL in a particular zone, links on the pages returned to the user have the public URL for that zone.
