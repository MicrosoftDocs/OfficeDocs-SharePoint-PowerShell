parameters:

  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.
    NOTE: When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  name: Force
  description: |+
    This switch forces unregistration even if there are BLOBs still in use in the Remote Share BLOB Store.
    If there are BLOBs still in use in the BLOB store being unregistered, this cmdlet will throw an exception to prevent unintentionally unregistering a BLOB store in use.

    If there is a need to unregister such a BLOB store, you can run the cmdlet with this switch to ignore the detection of in use BLOBs in the BLOB store.

    It's not recommended to use this "-Force" switch because it will leave BLOBs in the SMB storage behind and make your SharePoint contents inaccessible.
    It's recommended to first migrate BLOBs and then unregister the Remote Share BLOB Store.
