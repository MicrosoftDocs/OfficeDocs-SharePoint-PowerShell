### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Enables task sync between Project Web App and the associated project site. Once this is enabled, tasks created in the enterprise project in Project Web App will sync to the task list on the project site associated with the project. This feature is disabled by default.

  If you enable this feature, the restrictions that come with SharePoint lists, such as the maximum number of items supported before throttling, apply.

  Syncing tasks uses the queue and can affect performance. You should enable it only if you really need it.

  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
