  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

    Only use HTTP when you are on a fully secure network that uses IPSEC (full encryption) or in a test environment that does not contain sensitive data.

name: Set-SPWOPIZone
description: |-
  The `Set-SPWOPIZone` cmdlet configures the zone that the current SharePoint farm will use to navigate the browser to the WOPI application (such as a server that runs Office Web Apps Server).
  The SharePoint Server page in the browser creates a frame that contains a page on the WOPI application.
  The zone for the URL of the WOPI application page is determined by this setting.

  If you do not set the zone, the default is "internal-HTTPS." If you select a zone that is not supported by the WOPI application, Office Web Apps will not work.
  Only use HTTP when you are on a fully secure network that uses IPSEC (full encryption) or in a test environment that does not contain sensitive data.
