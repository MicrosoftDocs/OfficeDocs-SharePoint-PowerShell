  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `New-SPWOPISuppressionSetting` cmdlet turns off Office Web Apps for the action, file name extension, or programmatic identifier (ProgId) that you've specified on the current SharePoint farm. 
  The cmdlet does this without removing the discovery information or the ability for users to use the SharePoint Share by link feature to send a link to a document and allow the recipient to use Office Web Apps for that document type.
  You may have to use this cmdlet if you want to use Excel Services to view Excel workbooks instead of the WOPI application (for example Office Web Apps Server).
