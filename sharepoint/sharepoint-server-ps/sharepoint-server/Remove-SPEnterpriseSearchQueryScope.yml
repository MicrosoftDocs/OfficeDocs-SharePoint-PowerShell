parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

  After you upgrade a Search service application to SharePoint Server, you can view shared scopes, but you cannot create, update, or delete them.
  Therefore, you cannot use this cmdlet for shared scopes after upgrade.
  However, you can convert shared scopes to result sources, which serve a similar purpose.
  Similarly, after you upgrade a SharePoint Server site collection to SharePoint Server, you can view local scopes, but you cannot create, update, or delete them.
  Therefore, you cannot use this cmdlet for local scopes after you upgrade a site collection.
  However, you can convert local scopes to result sources, which serve a similar purpose.

  The `Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryScope` cmdlet deletes one or more specified shared scopes from the query scope collection.
  A query scope represents a query results scope used by all shared search applications on the farm.
