  summary: ""
parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

name: Update-SPInfoPathAdminFileUrl
description: |-
  The `Update-SPInfoPathAdminFileUrl` cmdlet updates data connections in administrator-approved InfoPath form templates (.xsn files) and universal data connections (.udcx files).
  This allows for InfoPath data connections that reference the current farm to be updated when content is migrated to a different farm URL.
  This cmdlet cannot update any references to URLs that exist in form template business logic (code).
  Typically, this cmdlet is used with the `Import-SPInfoPathAdministratorFiles` cmdlet.
