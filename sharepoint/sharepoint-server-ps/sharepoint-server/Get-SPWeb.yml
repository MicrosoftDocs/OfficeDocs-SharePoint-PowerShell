parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The Get-SPWeb cmdlet returns all subsites that match the scope given by the Identity parameter.
  All subsites that meet the criteria are returned.

  The Identity can be either the full URL or a relative path.
  If you specify a relative path, you must also specify the Site parameter to identify the site collection from which to return the subsite.

  The Identity parameter also supports providing a partial URL that ends in a wildcard character (*).
  All subsites that match this partial URL for the specified scope are returned.
  Additionally, if the Regex parameter is provided, the Identity parameter is treated as a regular expression and any subweb with a URL provided in the given scope that matches the expression is returned.

  The Filter parameter is a server-side filter for certain subsite properties that are stored in the content database; without the Filter parameter, filtering on these properties is a slow process. 
  These subsite properties are Template and Title.
  The Filter parameter is a script block that uses the same syntax as a Where-Object statement, but is run server-side for faster results.

  It is important to note that every site collection returned by the Get-SPWeb cmdlet is automatically disposed of at the end of the pipeline.
  To store the results of Get-SPWeb in a local variable, the Start-SPAssignment and Stop-SPAssignment cmdlets must be used to avoid memory leaks.
