parameters:
- type: <xref href="SPAssignmentCollection" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AssignmentCollection
  description: |+
    Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
    Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
    Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
    When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

    When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
    If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the `Stop-SPAssignment` command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

description: |-
  The `Upgrade-SPSite` cmdlet starts the upgrade process on a site collection.

  The `Upgrade-SPSite` cmdlet activates the upgrade process for the specified SPSite object.
  You can also use this cmdlet to resume failed upgrades.
  When you use this cmdlet to initiate upgrade on an SPSite object, the object can be either a build-to-build or version-to-version upgrade.

  By default, the `Upgrade-SPSite` cmdlet operates as a build-to-build upgrade.
  This prevents unexpected version upgrades of site collections if you use this cmdlet after a patching operation.
  When in version-to-version upgrade mode, site collection health checks are run in repair mode to ensure that the site collection is healthy enough to upgrade successfully.
  If successful, the remainder of the upgrade occurs.
