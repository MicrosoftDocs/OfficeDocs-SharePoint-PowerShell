# PnP PowerShell overview

PnP PowerShell is a .NET Core 3.1 / .NET Framework 4.6.1 based PowerShell Module providing over 600 cmdlets that work with Microsoft 365 environments such as SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Project, Security & Compliance, Microsoft Entra ID, and more.

For more information about installing or upgrading to this module, refer to these [PnP PowerShell articles](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/index.html).

## Supportability and SLA for PnP PowerShell cmdlets

This library is an open-source and community-provided library with an active community providing support for it. It is not a Microsoft-provided module so there's no SLA or direct support for this open-source component from Microsoft. You can, however, report any issues using the [issues list in GitHub](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/issues).

PnP PowerShell is initiative part of the larger community and open-source work under the [Microsoft 365 platform community (PnP)](https://aka.ms/m365pnp) initiative.

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online_
